# Dark UX & Growth anti-patterns

Please don't force creative, driven, & trustworthy designers to do dishonest work in growth & data settings. The anger & resentment you fuel once they leave you will stain your product for a lifetime. It's not 2004 anymore, privacy will be measured im real world ramifications. If you dare think I won't help map how many dollars & tax payer time you waste, I'm happy to show you what a real CSPAN hearing will look like. Same with creatives (color & sound). Same with creative copy.

It's the everyday things that will cement their power of usability over you before my vengance. Thanks!
