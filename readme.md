# A 100 days to reinvent oneself, community, and - eventually - the world

## 0-3
1. In what is expected to be a inverted change to the driver and target for human prowess: 2021 is the year of driving change with the input in mind, not the out-and-gone (hehe).
2. While I find the abstract nature of current progress an unwelcome goosebump, I think it's worth spending upto day 7 making sure I develop a palate for the hard things that will yield cumulative returns unparalled by the rolled down sleeve.
3. Like the stunna Bruce Lee reminds you: flow baby; like water.

Define thesis

UPDATE: A lot more reading than thesis deliberation but we do have a first project focus defined! Which I guess means an experiment is likely due soon. Couldn't hear your critique over the sound of progress! This has been really messy and a reality check in a lot of ways but I think it's starting to somewhat come around. 80/20 principle stands.

Feedback loop

### TRANSITION PERIOD AFTER 100D
100 days after March 11th, the start of this project, is June 19th but in realizing the significance of that day it seems more appropriate to make my official last day be June 20th. The expectation is to just do a log twice that day and that's it. The sucess of this project and initative is to show that grit, showing up, & refusing all other prizes but day 100 is what it takes to succeed. No matter what, I will always celebrate and appreciate day 1 version of me who dared to dream big, bold, and vulnerably. Thank you and I hope this becomes a positive lesson for a lifetime about counterfactual thinkng.
