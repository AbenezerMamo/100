# Follow-Up

Please investigate the CIA and their efforts to stop this project from reaching 100.

I will be leaving the U.S. because I will not stand for their lack of integrity and respect to patriotic contributors to global and American interests. They are commiting treason in my eyes.

Thank you for all you have done for me America. I am sorry this is how it ends for us.

God Bless,
Abenezer Mamo

# A 100 days to reinvent oneself, community, and - eventually - the world

## 0-3
1. In what is expected to be a inverted change to the driver and target for human prowess: 2021 is the year of driving change with the input in mind, not the out-and-gone (hehe).
2. While I find the abstract nature of current progress an unwelcome goosebump, I think it's worth spending upto day 7 making sure I develop a palate for the hard things that will yield cumulative returns unparalled by the rolled down sleeve.
3. Like the stunna Bruce Lee reminds you: flow baby; like water.

Define thesis

UPDATE: A lot more reading than thesis deliberation but we do have a first project focus defined! Which I guess means an experiment is likely due soon. Couldn't hear your critique over the sound of progress! This has been really messy and a reality check in a lot of ways but I think it's starting to somewhat come around. 80/20 principle stands. 

## 21-31
Create experiment
> What do I think is going to happen? Just sauce https://youtu.be/g0-F88c6Hrk To not get lost, stay commited so we started a Lab! Live out the lab! cd Prince's Crib

## 31-50
Feedback loop
> Turns out, building a shared layer for my hypothesis experimentation was useful so I chose Git-PAID as the first project to run it through.

## 50-70
Measure what matters
+ Latest pitch on the 100 Day thingy: "It's on me!" Would have the Christian in me out last year if i said "free beer!"
+ Fail condition simplified: If there exists a 101.md file in the journal or there are any changes to the repo after Day 100
+ I worked on having a body that can pick up and enjoy any activity; a heart that won't take anything out on 1. the world 2. another being 3. myself - as it should be: you were none the wiser; and I learned to embrace and embody the person I used to be only with others and began to accept him as someone I choose to grow into now that I know it's possible.
- Ask a question.
- *Jurassic Park Shaving Cream* See....
- "Where the * do I even really start?" - Star Boy #...*yikes* What a time to live alive yo. Let's get it!

* Lab, reading, & all the "functions" should be ready to go. I need to read a lot more than build. So I will try to get back to coding on the 70th. I need inspiration from everywhwere. Staff eng level by Day 80 for sure tho - Top 5. Bet.
## 70-80
Ideate
- I learned that robots are dumb b/c they are trying to hold me accountable for stuff I don't even know I'll want to be around for. Honestly, I don't really care that better outcomes were made and it was for the better: failing to deliver is the kind of feeling and emotion only humans can understand. I'd say break another one but damn....
+ Still trying to make this whole life-long self-paced continous learning thing kinda work. Luckily, I can let it roll off me like *flick* but sometimes I might be in my feelings about the past so I apologize if the times, progress, & feelings feel at odds. Welcome to leadership.

## 80-95
Identify delta
+ Still plan on bailing ship and going in radicaly different path by day 90 though that could mean 100 off, 99 acceptance, 98 ought-to, 97 really?, and 96 "oh, yeah!?" so that's maybe about 12 or 13 days left.
- Make sure to remember what happens when you make fraction jokes and only start to freak out when you realize you've been counting up the days........*can't decide if to laugh or to sobb so i'll just comic relief*
+ Warn future aspiring streakers to be careful and dwarn them to decide which works best for them as to avoid self-agony or trying to one up me by reversing and then finding it to have the same outcome. Whew. This would never work in short form....*audible tweet giggle*

## 95-99

Live change(d)

Thank you for tuning in. I hope you enjoyed & learned something. Please tell history I stopped with "about a week to go -- week to go." 93 days of ment, commitment. I love you Lina. Thanks for breaking my heart. I said it was you or nothing and you thought I was joking. I wasn't. The world got something out of my heart break and my clapback to you to prove that I can indeed - commit. *keyboard flip*

### TRANSITION PERIOD AFTER 100D
100 days after March 11th, the start of this project, is June 19th but in realizing the significance of that day it seems more appropriate to make my official last day be June 20th. The expectation is to just do a log twice that day and that's it. The sucess of this project and initative is to show that grit, showing up, & refusing all other prizes but day 100 is what it takes to succeed. No matter what, I will always celebrate and appreciate day 1 version of me who dared to dream big, bold, and vulnerably. Thank you and I hope this becomes a positive lesson for a lifetime about counterfactual thinkng.

# One last thing...

What my eyes have yet to see; my ears have yet to hear; and my mind yet to fathom. 1000x GDP.

Yesterday, June 20th around 11:45 PM I had the realization that yes we did actually meet our goal & yes it was in front of us the whole time. Here it is:

90% of financial crimes commited against the elderly are done by those in their family. Given wealth transfer being larger single transaction than a F series delay & Airbus/Boeing geopolitical chess match, I figured it would be easier to solve than a Nordic 20-80% guilt trip. Ahem.

Since my decade run in ads, green candle & thicc whicc market karate chop, & 4 letter last name power move over the Trump family and economists...sorry let me get back on track:

Yes. Pacing.

Used to take $1M to afford a Good Year but now it's apparently $2M. By the of my run it might be 2 Satoshi but anyways: the true currency is my 2c USD. Crisp. On the side. Always ready to slide.

Yes. Pacing.

Let's figure out how to do hot & cold better than a Katey Perry single and we might just make the world dance.

Yes. Pacing.

God bless you. God bless America.


Forever,
Good Thru
