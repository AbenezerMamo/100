Let's jump into the post honeymoon stage of your project shipping and let's make sure we figure out how to frame our thinking to be cognizant of the bilateral, bi-directional, transactional (assume positive), & value driven nature of your life's greatest work. My wish for you is that these ideas and thoughts help spark a candle that can keep your creativity kindling with sustainability, vigor, & verbosity. Also, I choose the last one over robhustness b/c it just seems to sound to be like it's "extra" for no other reason other than your own and doesn't need to be too bundled. I'll try to exercise more deliberation in verbiage in this folder but don't let that take away from the playful, light-hearted, & celebratory nature of what it's all about......the  cool stuff you made randomly or of random that needs to see the light of day!!!
