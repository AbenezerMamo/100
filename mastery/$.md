0. You got me next time; this one is on me!
1. JP & Rockefella (Controlled 90% of American oil, largest philanthropist, & richest in modern history)
2. Elon v.s. Squeezes, African Businessman of the Year, & Model E
3. Obsession with having their own jets (President Trump, Drake, Metro, Pen Glides)
4. Wayne (Young/Cash Money, Birdman, & OVO)
5. John Doer (OKRs)
6. Andy Groove (Intel & MBA's)
7. Peter Thiel (The modern day founders Sears catalogue. *Queue into Dixon and all the "Fuck a War" crew*)
8. Brian v.s. Everyone in crypto, Ethereum, & $1 of Bitcoin emails (btw I wanted to join to help CB win web3 bc I trust them with my money and yes I understand why the military & security people need to not have opinions bc I don't expect many to understand why you need to protect those who wear capes in broad day light. Lastly: I believe I've brought the wave (liquidity) to them before but you gotta respect Olaf, the kids on the referral hustle - respect, & of course $250M for the bad ass lady who is not only part of the success but also was on the legislative side. She says "please come do crime on the Bitcoin blockchain." A good example of responsibly cashing in on career capital & moat. Lastly, thanks TRUMP/WeWork/VisionFund, Leo/Clooney/WillSmithKids/007/Opera/MKBHD, JB/23/Drake/Elvis/Tupac/MJ for teaching me a lesson on family, being responsible stunners who could make order of magnitude more than you if they wanted to cash in, and why it's always important to pick one person and make sure you can bet on them and build a relationship that allows you to have the world benefit from the gifts and value that they will fall in love with when someone more pure in youth, naïveté, & desire to excell that you get to coach, sponsor, & be willing to lose it all on) So I made sure I tried to be the best I can I'm being authentic and try to not feel like I have to be somebody to do something; try to break the cycles that the next generation only could if they realized that you just gotta "love yourz; change from the inside; and stop hating on Rich N***** (Negus - "king" in Ethiopia's Amharic))]
