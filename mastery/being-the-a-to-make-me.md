# "If you're reading this", it's not too late for you

Congruent with Day 1 me, Day 71 us, and what was to be our collective transient of living what we changed collectively:

1. It's on me so don't worry about it: whatever is here in this 100 day repo and all that it radiates around you
2. While however surprising: I'm not a charity and you are not a charity case. *This* is shared value that I, and many blessings & grace, have seeded long ago with time, energy, & sacrifice 2 orders of magnitude higher than this effort (10,000 hours = ~27 years and I'm almost 25)
3. These 100 Days were in response to something in my life that you, nor what couldn't have been, would begin to understand as to why I have to accept the darkness in me that would have otherwise prefered to not stick around the whole 100 Days to watch the world flourish away from what I could, should, would, and etc...Sorry kid, welcome to being born a sinner.
