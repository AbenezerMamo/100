# Most useful work you can create is one that's easy to add on to

I realize this may get overwhelming so I'm going to try to figure out how to - complain to devs - improve the tools for creating and collaboration. Also, I'm going to try to frame a prompt so it can just get to 8 questions of "why"

Ex:
1) why do we write?
2) why is front loading the emotions important in communication?
3) what emotions are we trying to rid our words of for others to consume?
4) what immediate emotion do we avoid from the reader when delivering it a sync?
5) what is the most potent emotion that can evokes a response?
6) how much are you likely to read before commenting without getting wrekt on a technicality?
7) what gradient of quality and deliberation do we seek from the comments or responses to our work?
8) is my content as quality as the responses I'm nurturing?
* what's poppin*
9) what would the 2 responses back and forth look like as responses to my content from 2-3 authors?
10) what can I provide as creative collateral to make barrier to "clear context" lower?
11) can I make it easy to embed the content where it would best be maximizing the screen real estate and the stopping power on a page, feed, or even video frame?


# Themes
Now that it's clear that work is continuous, iterative, and always on our mind, it's time we stop living in systems and declare the delays!!!!

Themes are a lesson I learned from my previous boss who split the week into days where writing and critique sessions were made deliberate with deep work built in (Cal Newport's 2 hour work cycles)

As to not make a fool of myself, I'll simply just focus on the eng related tasks.
For instance: networking, API, client, or data related work could be batched?
Who knows, maybe that's a horrible idea because I'm not a professional SWE. Lesson here is themes, not planning!
