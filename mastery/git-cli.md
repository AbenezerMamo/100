### Git Command line

1. File history appears as a snapshot in time called "commits"
2. "Git Add" is part of the staging process in a 2-part step for transacting the changes made
3. "Git commit" completed the change-tracking process for all that's in prevue of the prior staging process
4. "Git status"
   A) Untracked
   B) Modified
   C) Staged
5. Pull requests can operate in two coordination models
   A) Shared Repository Model: The pull request is part of a conversation regarding commit scope & merging
   B) Fork & Pull System: The pull request is a vehicle for changes to have alerts propagated and to review changes for merging to main branch
6. Pull requests are written in Markdown. (Images & Emoji can be imbedded)
7. Revisions and paths are denoted by prefix "--"

## Follow-up Questions
1. How might we be able to leverage pull-requests to unlock new verification methods that are more natively integrated with the rest of the git-paid project?
2. Considering the changes we make locally, is it worth asking if shared activities in git-paid should consider concurrency or asynchronous pair-programming at a "Untracked", "Modified", or "Staged" level? How does this fit within the scope of the limited set of affordances we can provide while in real-time?
