# My long awaited boss level: IG-er a.k.a. grammar a.k.a. business casual writing

1. Do not send an essay to X, people measuring you on 5 Ys, or when you should be catching Z's
2. Generally, write it out before you give someone the low-down. It keeps the down part real low because you front-loaded the emotions of having the last word, volume, & gradiet of emotions
3. If you need it, grab a pen and you'll be glad the slow & frustraiting effect of writing each letter of the 4 pages "DAMN, good job kiddo"
4. Generally, be comfortable with your long distance relationships causing interal rifts about your oral lingual skills catching up. It's looking more like an ego fragility thing now that I'm writing it out...
5. Don't be afraid to lean into your natural voice, it's the one that doesn't need influence or persuading
6. Be mindful of random habits just b/c
7. Don't be afraid of finding your true self being a lot more comfortable with intimate & genuine emotions now that you're inking the feelings as an outlet for whatever....*finds a needle in a haystack: yes, time for mice...* (No, I have not read it)
8. Be clear when you're wanting to make references to things you know the name of and things you know *gulp. me too. me too*
