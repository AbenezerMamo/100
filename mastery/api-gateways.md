API Gateways (https://www.globallogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Microservice-Architecture-API-Gateway-Conside)

API Gateways are the layer that can unify various clients, services, and premissions all through one provisioning system. For timely, with fault tolerance guarantees, and adequately in-use resourcing, there need to exist one set of rules that govern the protocol-like & containerized execution enviroments. It's recommended that two channels remain actively dormant for buffer in order to meet high reliability standards. For counters & other record based transactions, multi-threaded processing within designated high-ways allow for consistent throughput. For request & response handling, the gateway can allow segmentation for custom moderation & whitelisting based on authentication, token, or effective enforcement filters.
