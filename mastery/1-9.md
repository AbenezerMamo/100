Double digit mean you have to expand our capacity to be able to be comfortable with an extra digit. If you want to get the whole 100, then remember that "there's levels to this" so it's upto you to show up for 101 and there's no class that can teach you that. You have to be ready to accept that you may not know what "double digit" version of your leveling might look like before you start to imagine being 100x better, more, and "whole" that's waiting for you to actualize and realize.
