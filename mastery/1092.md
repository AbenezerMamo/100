This is an entity that represents anyone looking to contribute without having the burden of feel-good projects dirtying up your rep. But more seriously: it's a collective experience to be shaped by the process. Some say great things come of 1092 units of excitement! Get the idea?

What it is:
- I don't really know yet. Mainly, whatever this project couldn't be. Open to feedback. Meant to work for you - not you working for it. 
- Some accountability and more decisive momentum (as a result of allocation, not process haha)

What it isn't:
- A for-profit corporation
- Patents and closed gardens. Open source but keep in mind the profits benefit the collective and as such, the privilege is in resource allocation governance. More active & early pioneers benefit from being able to have "institutional" knowledge to build early credibility & influence. Let the games begin haha! No, but I'm seriously excited but cautiously optimistic bc this could also be a bad idea
