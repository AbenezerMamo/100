In order to understand your role in being a catalyst for change, it's important that you consider that bringing your best and improved self is aligned with that of what your team and company need so that you can vacate your role and move up - having hopefully already had your replacement be better than you at that role. It was a little hard to figure out how to make it easy to be helped in my career b/c of the indvidual conttributor nature of product management. So a good heuristic I picked up from one of my bosses is that i should consider my behavior to be something that we can design around and measure. Obviously this is where I *gulp* and nervously try to bring a smile. It's uncomfortable and it's hard to know if this is useful or not. Most times: you're met with a reality mirror and it's just not.......fun to be changed or go through it. You just want to feel the effects of it. That's why Im trying to design my work here to make sure that the tacit knowlegge I have gained can be appropriately abstrated to you in the form of "tactile" feeback loop. If i'm wrong, it'll be clear that it was from the start...or somethwere in there. Trying to build an event server right now.
