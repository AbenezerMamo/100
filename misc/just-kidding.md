1. Heard you can sell a key to God bro; but I only deliver the values. Serial key to life is to make sure you got the plug with people that'll have Metro, Biz Boomin, and no-singing at my funeral. On that topic: walked into a store once and a mom came on explaining her son's recent death led to her and the mourners to be pleasantly surprised by what they all learned of each other's presence. I'm not an artist and YOlO just like you so I'll appreciate and enjoy all this world has to offer. But honestly: I might just play "put my money in the grave" on repeat. Idk man, I'm good where I'm at too. Scared of the guap so the next 47 days are on me. No vacation; a new type of vocation. "Change locations." Now on the Redis caches and tokens wanna swap; no - wait. But really; "it's on me". After that: "f*ck you; pay me."
2. (Out of bounds)
3. Not for higher b/c I don't lower my standards. Just kidding. Got the 1099 man. Lookin for the "whole 100"
4. Clean up good dawg but still in my own lane
5. If I turn my skills and abilities into functions, does that mean I get a callback? "cHolla back" > "please say sum"
