The intention is to be able to create a folder structure that adheres to the expectations, current state, and the limited provisions that exist for you to manage media or file storage as my friend Thanasi once said. So I've thought of a new way at to do so using the native line items, schema, & information hierarchy.

For instance, you might find a folder for each day's Journal entry for the team. We can assume - akin to index.html - that readme.md would be able to serve the same function in Github. What's more? *Billy Mays smile* AND:

1. 000 incr every 24 hours
2. Start with 100 folders and expect each day to time box segment the first intilialized empty folder with a readme.md
3. Same as 2 but you have precreated files and you expect to see a diff each 24 hours on the same hierarchy as 2
4. Start with 100 readme.md files in the repo and every 24 hours you expect to see one disappear into a newly minted folder to index and associate with it. The folder could be an incrementer, tag, date, custom timestamp, key:value, tuples of (folder_name, directory_id_incr_from_0, and finally Boolean values to match, exclude, include, and obviously conclude.
