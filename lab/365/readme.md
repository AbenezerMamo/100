365 days are cool but 100 days into the year is even better. That's usually April 10th. If your kid decided to freak my cheat code i invalided and broke yesterday and locked today...they would have had an extra 10 days; giving themselves until April 20th to have completed my challenge. So give them the day off that day anyway as a way of rewarding them for the almost not self-deprecating behavior that only robs them out of future satisfaction of what their dreams could have been. Bake it a good day!
