# Technical Design Document: Data Flow

### Thank you Make School community for helping me understand these complex concepts in simple ways and always sharing time & support. Please don't let my code be a reflection of the quality of your skills and work. I'll get back to my spreadsheets and documents next...

# Principles

Operating with the agility required to sustain the "continuous game" (Stratechery, a16z) in providing a high quality of service is best anchored in "ELO" (MOBA) tiers of temporal portfolio & SLA strategies with clear definitions of Unpaved Paths.

A local park in San Francisco has a trail that's gated with a dazzlingly boring map chiseled into a rough tint of dark blue granite engraved with khaki-pant looking valleys in each letter block all along the key and bird-eye view of the park. That trail happens to denote in dark solid lines the Paved Paths and in dotted lines the Unpaved Paths. In further delineation: -- Paths have circle cutouts while the -- Paths are filled mapping a boolean of access. For explorers from all walks of life & circumstance, there are Alternate Paths that are denoted in thin lines of Zebra style. The blocks of rectangles can either have corner radius be curved or straight edged. From this walk, I took away the importance of deliberate design; especially if your map happens to be carved into stone. We will take the same approach in deliberation, quality, & verifiable fairness with a long term greedy mindset.
