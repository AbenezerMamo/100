Understanding how data flows is a much more practical, tangible, & actionable exercise that can identify levers for transformative change. Now, is your API call hogging wasteful bandwdith b/c some PM structured the data schema so you can't get that value without having tot get the serial lookup key from another table? I can relate, k values aren't so friendly in my geo-fence. I like to think global...I'm talking under water cable global. I'm talking mini Shuttle so you can freak your little "journey" on military technology & infra that is called GPS but you forget can just be another "we started from the bottom but now the whole team freaking here". Where's here? *I didnt know we were here" Same. There's 14 versions of here man so make sure you can see all of me that I brought too because I don't need a response...just a deserialized request
