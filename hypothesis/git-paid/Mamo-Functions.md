# So I'm feeling myself so I thought I'd turn myself into AWS-like functions but for graduating students, SMBs, and couple (with little ones too).


### Not freaking it

1. What data from this platform can I use?


2. What data from this platform can I not combine?


3. What does this platform allow me to do if I automated my authentication?


4. What are other people saying about maximizing the recommendations on this platform?


### Not overflowing....

1. How much time has passed since I made a decision to do X?


2. How much time has passed since I last made any intentional decision?

3. What integrated and provisioned conditional-forecast can I set on X platform so it only triggers if I give Y input before Z time expires?


4. How long has it been since Event X happened? How long has it been since the last Marker on this stopwatch? ("Marker" is a Twitch stream's timestamp that is like a "Chapter" or "bookmark")



### Media and creatives

1. I want to use [image, video, GIF, PDF, or MP3] on my website, app, and marketing channels. Which platforms have the most relevant size, quality, & library for my objective? [selling, activating, scanning, tapping, "bumping/NFC"]

2. I would like to upload media or files that I want to encode directly into URL params. Which public or cached (source provisioned) HTTP request can I make that can be envoked from any browser?

3. What are the community filtered words, topics, or contexts to avoid for the video, audio, or photo that I want to take from Source X to Destination Y under Z's account


### Prototyping
1. What is the process and manual for facilitating a design sprint for X days with Y cross-functional members and Z pixel event? (I kind of just imagined A FB-web-pixel-like attribution model that optimized, scored, & infered based on the end outcomes that can be generalized)
2.Examples:
3.- Github contributors
4.- Livestreaming share-out (watch parties)
5.- A/B testing for different outcome measurements (I'm going to suggest ad measurement study questions to serve as common lagging indicators to leverage. This aligns directly with being able to offer a generalized service that doesn't create fatigue by adopting to both high and low fidelity attribution).

More specifically:
1. Consideration
2. Recall
3. Favorability
4. Intention

By starting with these 4, we can begin to abstract the actual front-end interface, input form, and the interactivity of the process. We focus on leveraging basic mechanisms that exist in web 2.0
1. Media side by side
2. Radio selection
3. Range / gradient scoring
4. Time / date picker (past, future, duration, and frequency)

Now, by taking in the required inputs for the 4 input mechanisms on the Creator side (you the biz, dev, organizer) so a lot of iterative, playful, & natively interactive experiences can be built to make it fun, meaningful, and rewarding to have public participation. Who knows, that could be an opportunity for one of you to build on top of that as a platform. It is a leap of faith to build on top of platforms, both the giants and hot-cake-SaaSy-DTC-inc..., but it's important to see that aggregation strategies at some point warrent vertical growth and growing the pie. (See google/fb/telecoms growing internet users to grow market). I think I'd like to find a respecful way to learn from Jio and the Indian market when it comes to growing and investing in lockstep with where consumer media, bandwith, and UX usage and habits are. I plan to have no financial conflict here so I hope any mentions of investments and market movements not be a signal, advice, or change of my focus. Now, go see why people actually like the service and it's a pretty big deal for US economy and early signal that early partnerships and equity deals can point to how the big players see themselves adding value in a world which western companies mostly compete and rarely do big rounds with little rivalrly. Ok, bye. M&A teams hate him!
