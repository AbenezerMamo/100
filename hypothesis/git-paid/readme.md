# What if you could make open source hits like Metro? Trust me, Lopez got thisssss

## Standardizing 0-1
1. Extract the public data from your profile
2. Extract the public data from a repo
3. Ingest the auth-token permissioned routes based on a user's network, repositories, & activity log as to map the fan-out possibilities (who follows you, who you follow, and intra-social-graph network activity)


## What is the importance of distributed, componentized, and verifiable work?

It can allow the creative time of your work to not be bogged down by admin work or decisions that can be taken off your plate and exposed via a function, provisioned & isolated, to the 2-sided market that pairs you with most qualified response.

For companies, it could allow them to collaborate with the public and competitors to "grow the pie" or expand the market so there is more to grab from together. Recently, Rockstar implemented a fix from a player who was able to reduce load times for online by an insane amount (~70% if I remember correctly).

## What kinds of cooperative tasks

### Given the tremendous value in engineering skills, community, & influence, what are we consciously, fearfully, and confidently making clear about the principles, values, & rigor we place on the outwards and multi-user impact we create?

While this calls for a larger definition inside the main repo, it will suffice to state the specific deviations, exceptions, and discretion we'll need to call out here.

One bit of influence that is an inspiration for us here is believing and embracing that the wisdom of the crowd prevails when decentralization, independence, & diversity are preserved ("Wisdom of the Crowds" - Surowiecki). While this book's influence has been tremendous, we feel it fits this initiative's mission to build these tools in a way that champions, promotes, & influences these rights, proudly expending our own expend to make way for yours. For the social exchanges we facilitate, we ask for your help in protecting, preserving, & improving the change we make in hopes that you do so positively at an individual, communal, & at a - well spirited - global level.

### How do we consider the global nature of the developer community & the limited nature of our current understanding of the respective needs in each sub-community?

In a time when we rely more, and collectively support in bipartisan, the institutions and systems of the world we want to be intentional, proactive, & cautiously optimistic in building tools, promoting ideas, & leveraging resources towards our mission. As with any effort, the limited nature of our time, resources, & social capital will limit or expand the freedoms we subjectively exercise. In attempting to cultivate market, user privacy, & responsible oversight for the outcomes we create, we will not be in custodian or administration of what you can't live without after the 100 days are over in this overall effort. For everything we do facilitate & host until then, we do so in explicitly courteous & sometimes na√Øve manner so please be kind.


## Reasoning & Logic for Social Mechanisms

At an individual level, we assume a developer is a 3rd year Computer Science student preparing for a summer internship or a 4th year student preparing for a new grad position. While narrow in impact scope & audience, it allows us to be consistent in the common knowledge, social graph, & behavioral receptivity to the conditions & environments we design tasks, challenges, & tools around.

In defining our target audience, we can then leverage the skills, mastery, & experience each individual earns to facilitate their further growth. We'll leverage teaching & coaching opportunities and continuously increase the rigor by fairly promoting healthy intra-community competition. These could be Ranked cooperative ELO Challenges, team-only sessions, or just global 1:1 practice & experimenting playgrounds.

As we add more fidelity, it should enhance confidence & intention in what we assume each user should already knows, be comfortable asking, & grow confidence in facilitating. This will create opportunities in the end-to-end experience to define where tooling is best utilized, education is missing, and product onboarding should bridge missing context.

#### Milestones, events, & timelines in a user's universe

For a user preparing for an internship, we can will want to optimize sessions that pair:programming sessions can better match on their program's curriculum, portfolio, or extracurricular activities. These could be oracles that will require further deliberation & thought to either offloading to the client or entrusting existing organizations to manage & provision. This is out of concern for what possible aggregations, sampled, or taxonomized information could mean both for the user and those operating tools. For instance: choosing to display how long it took you to master a skill may not be useful when looking at comparisons. At the same time, intentionally storing the required information only so long as to unlock a certain achievement that can be a sharable celebration or recommendation into branching interests.

[Very much a work in progress]
