## Designing for tangible outcomes in mind
In choosing to invest in the developer community, we are explicit expecting it to yield the exponentially recriprocal step-function jumps in cooperative behavior that, if induced to cultivate the wisdom of the crowd, should allow for natural sprouting of efforts like ours. While inspiring you may catalyze some change today, it would be kind and indearing if we could attain fulfilment at the education, training, tooling, or just at the research level. You should expect to find comments in this Product Requirement Document that should outline where there are gaps that we expect our prototypes can help shed light on for academia, industry, and policy makers. That being said, our prototypes and experiments operate with race-horse vision by moving laterally in the end-to-end flow when pivoting as opposed to changing the customer. The most important work to do right is one that we will all have to pass through. We will focus on making your last 2 years of higher education holistically upleveling as you build tacit knowledge, participate in open source development, & exhibit specific behavioral transformations that you can trace across repos, orgs, & communities.

### Diving Deeper into outcome stages

#### Stage 0
1. Seeding SEO & content marketing improvements
   1. Portfolio
   2. Community Contributions (Forums, Tutorials, etc...)
   3. Blog
   4. Linkedin
2. Capturing linearly, however zig-zag, mastery development
   1. What books are you reading?
   2. What courses have you taken?
   3. What events or competitions have you particpated in?
   4. What class did you recently take?
   5. What shareable research did you compile?


#### Stage 1
1. Identifying the scope for your intended learning or career path
   1. Finding the most relevant person to ask a specific, substanstive, question can often be the powerful catalyst for you to build rappor and intimacy with a professional objective but cassual correspondence.
      1. Sharing latest porfolio additions for critique
      2. Eliciting critique on resume & cover letter
      3. Making use of articles, research, or insightful commentary as conversation pieces that you can begin to habitually grow comfortable using as no-pressure "small-talk". This can feel a little bit awkward or cringy but don't misinterpret it for disrespect or promoting disingenous anti-patterns.
2. Having a collaborative win that surfaces individual performance
   1. The onus is on you and you alone to clearly, confidently, & proudly paint the gravity & significance of your work when being evaluated by a possible teammate, employer, or coach.


#### Stage 2
There should be some skill based activity here.


#### Stage 3
There should be an interoperable & standardized history of your meaningful & actionable progress towards outcomes.

#### Stage 4
You should be teaching the next lesson. Aspirationally, having this be part of Skill development in stage 2 would be nice.

#### Stage 5
Delays in the system. Which ones should we anticipate or make affordances to cushin?

(Very much a work in progress)

## Standardizing 0-1
1. Extract the public data from your profile
2. Extract the public data from a repo
3. Ingest the auth-token permissioned routes based on a user's network, repositories, & activity log as to map the fan-out possibilities (who follows you, who you follow, and intra-social-graph network activity)

## What is the importance of distributed, componentized, and verifiable work?

It can allow the creative time of your work to not be bogged down by admin work or decisions that can be taken off your plate and exposed via a function, provisioned & isolated, to the 2-sided market that pairs you with most qualified response.

For companies, it could allow them to collaborate with the public and competitors to "grow the pie" or expand the market so there is more to grab from together. Recently, Rockstar implemented a fix from a player who was able to reduce load times for online by an insane amount (~70% if I remember correctly).

## What kinds of cooperative tasks

### Given the tremendous value in engineering skills, community, & influence, what are we consciously, fearfully, and confidently making clear about the principles, values, & rigor we place on the outwards and multi-user impact we create?

While this calls for a larger definition inside the main repo, it will suffice to state the specific deviations, exceptions, and discretion we'll need to call out here.

One bit of influence that is an inspiration for us here is believing and embracing that the wisdom of the crowd prevails when decentralization, independence, & diversity are preserved ("Wisdom of the Crowds" - Surowiecki). While this book's influence has been tremendous, we feel it fits this initiative's mission to build these tools in a way that champions, promotes, & influences these rights, proudly expending our own expend to make way for yours. For the social exchanges we facilitate, we ask for your help in protecting, preserving, & improving the change we make in hopes that you do so positively at an individual, communal, & at a - well spirited - global level.

### How do we consider the global nature of the developer community & the limited nature of our current understanding of the respective needs in each sub-community?

In a time when we rely more, and collectively support in bipartisan, the institutions and systems of the world we want to be intentional, proactive, & cautiously optimistic in building tools, promoting ideas, & leveraging resources towards our mission. As with any effort, the limited nature of our time, resources, & social capital will limit or expand the freedoms we subjectively exercise. In attempting to cultivate market, user privacy, & responsible oversight for the outcomes we create, we will not be in custodian or administration of what you can't live without after the 100 days are over in this overall effort. For everything we do facilitate & host until then, we do so in explicitly courteous & sometimes na√Øve manner so please be kind.


## Reasoning & Logic for Social Mechanisms

At an individual level, we assume a developer is a 3rd year Computer Science student preparing for a summer internship or a 4th year student preparing for a new grad position. While narrow in impact scope & audience, it allows us to be consistent in the common knowledge, social graph, & behavioral receptivity to the conditions & environments we design tasks, challenges, & tools around.

In defining our target audience, we can then leverage the skills, mastery, & experience each individual earns to facilitate their further growth. We'll leverage teaching & coaching opportunities and continuously increase the rigor by fairly promoting healthy intra-community competition. These could be Ranked cooperative ELO Challenges, team-only sessions, or just global 1:1 practice & experimenting playgrounds.

As we add more fidelity, it should enhance confidence & intention in what we assume each user should already knows, be comfortable asking, & grow confidence in facilitating. This will create opportunities in the end-to-end experience to define where tooling is best utilized, education is missing, and product onboarding should bridge missing context.

#### Milestones, events, & timelines in a user's universe

For a user preparing for an internship, we can will want to optimize sessions that pair:programming sessions can better match on their program's curriculum, portfolio, or extracurricular activities. These could be oracles that will require further deliberation & thought to either offloading to the client or entrusting existing organizations to manage & provision. This is out of concern for what possible aggregations, sampled, or taxonomized information could mean both for the user and those operating tools. For instance: choosing to display how long it took you to master a skill may not be useful when looking at comparisons. At the same time, intentionally storing the required information only so long as to unlock a certain achievement that can be a sharable celebration or recommendation into branching interests.

[Very much a work in progress]
