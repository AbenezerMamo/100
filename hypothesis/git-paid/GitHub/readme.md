Ok. Imagine this is a repo front page. Main directory. Root. That's moat.

Take that and then create 31 folded each with a readme.md inside.

Bam. Slam. Jam. What do you have?

Each day you take the readme.md out of the folder and into the main directory.

- So there should be 30 folders with filers out of the 31 total.
- Before the day ends, the readme.md file has to be put back into the folder.
- The current day's folder will lock edit or write permissions if it's not on the same day.
- There can't exist 2 readme.md files in the main directory at the same time.
- If you fail to not only return today's readme.md file into its respective folder, but also not have moved the next day's readme.md file into the main directory, then you would have failed due to the read permissions being disabled as a result of the folder now no longer logically sound given that it would have been today's tomorrow or "today"

Whew. Me too. Okay, let's get back to it:

- The goal is to reframe what governance in protocols mean to begin with. Assume that people before you weren't stupid and probably looked at mediocre depth but likely vast breadth to create your soon to be transient fit. Ahem. But yes, file systems have got me worked up. But for the next 42 days, it's on me! Okay, I like to be on the side of history that gets us off ads and cringe binge - see that's a rhyme for 0 dime. Anyway, take a leap of faith and build on top of platforms you like and trust as your personal infra.

Whew. Me too. Sentimal mental. Deep mind. "Never mind."

- CRUD permissions are fairly ubiquitous in structure so assume that to work.
- More interesting is time. Thanks NASA & - *gulp* "thank you Hitler???", def not me - for UNIX time. Lots of talented folks who were forced into working for evil corrupt jerks got a chance to really take lead at NASA and other departments within civil service that you'd find if you're a student of history. As such, 2008 is my personal focus area for the era to be studying closely. Yes I've seen the HBO show too - relax; I'm talking about Money, Prosperity, & the shock that was felt for those whose long term earnings took 5% hit on average and likely to 1-3 years given up - and likely more if we don't learn from their pain and deal with stress strategically
- So time. It's been 23 minutes and 37 seconds since the stopwatch has been running.
- Block times were the next evolution. Jan 1970 was a serial entrepreneur's breakfast. CRON jobs were gone like "hot cakes". P/L were the marquee of the fruit stands that funded the 57% gain of when homies were taking -2% annual while Drake raps about losing $8M; Theiel is like same bro $8B. *looks both ways* Golden crosses in my EMA.
