### How to turn information into intelligence using concept mapping, improvements proposed, and rudimentary concepts in data structures / “data flow”


# Atomic data representation

### What is a node? How might renaming it change our understanding?

#### Taking queue from SYNC — a book on order amidst chaos
Let's consider how an “Oscillator” might evolve our definition of a leaf or a node. What makes this Oscillator be deserving of its name?
It can have cascading effects to neighboring information that can
1) SYNC applications
- Heart
- Fireflies


4) Red Zones (Memory sanitization)
Keeping a fence around the number of Oscillators you can have in a series

5) Osmos (game)
Eat up Oscillators around as to enlarge itself
- Property changes
- Aggregation
- Clustering / Grouping

### What could a node represent on the map?
One set of possibilities are mappings of a concept with key:value dictionary mapping to enable inherited, decaying, evolving, & eventually immutable attributes that allow it to become more than just a premise or an idea.

7) Node expiry
As denoted by block # for blockchains, it could be useful to propose a counter of sibling nodes as an Integer to begin to reliably set data expiry without state management or external clock

8) Less than or Greater than
This binary response could allow predefined elimination schemes to essentially prove authenticity, increase lifespan, & even grow resilient the Oscilators to which it’s applied

9) Provisioning atomically and within a branch (Git baseline features can apply but omitting some to optimize for cascading effects could be a possibility too. Let's make a case for it.)
