1. It would be nice to have the behavior you want to reward have a unique and celebratory interaction / experience. Snap streaks are a good example. Back in my day, pimples were how you got anybody's attention. Then it became objectified and numbers were everywhere. It was mass hysteria: people would endlessly swipe and tap to defeat this boss level scheme. Children and man-child alike came together to get to 0. Achieving what some may call the cruelest captcha. Are you willing to believe there is clarity after the "1" pimple is left? Do you care to tap until you tap out? 
2. A timer that you keep snoozing losses it value very quickly. Try a stopwatch. I came back and 2 seconds went by. Uh oh 11 seconds. Make a wish!
3. How long it's been since you reset it should give you really good compass as you present-porn your way to zen. Versatile for any activity or vice or experiment to measure. Just know the longest scientific experiment was to see if you got the drip. "I ain't gonna do it!" Scratch. Freeze. *everybody...*
