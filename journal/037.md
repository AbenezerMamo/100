# Friday April 16th, 2021

Today is a new day; an opportunity; and a chance to spread enchantment.

------------------------------

Also today, we have moved goal posts to spending the weekend on the beta because I am not prepared and I'd like to give myself more time. The duality of life.

Today's focus:
On network connection between Redis & Node.

Tomorrow:
Testing

Sunday:
Service status page & super basic json analytics end point

New ship goal date: Sunday night


# Focus for today
