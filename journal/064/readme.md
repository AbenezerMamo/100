Today has yet to be used to its fullest potential; it's new! Today is a the opportunity that knocks. Today is my one and only; jk, that is reserved for someone else and I can't take any chances without invalidating the first. Whew...getting real deep there homie. You good? "If God got us then we gonna be alright!"

A 100 Days might inspire the feelings you came with. That's a choice to feel; good or bad. That is a singular choice that deviaing from will rob us of what we're cheering you on to become. Even if it's hard, you have to trust that we will take care of you, yours, and your meaning in this world. Each day you're here is a day you get to make the world better for what matters to you. We all benefit from that and kinda makes sense why K-12 & retirement are the bedrocks of a modern western society. I am so delighted to feel the warmth and grace of your time here in invisble, transient, but tangible ways and means. Even if we won't get to meet or acknowledge each other...I just want to say thank you on behalf of us all. Make it a great day!

Cheers,
