Today is a brand new day.
Today is my opportunity.
Today is definitely Sunday...

Cheers!

Learned about DACIN at Twitter but wanted to make my own version with a twist. The sections above are more or less for me to be able to scrape for logging & documentation. They will also serve as TL;DR for your pleasure. "I got something saying to say!" :)


# DIARY
I fell asleep so I woke up with a different attitude: we are actually taking an intentional break today. I'll catch up on whatever is currently in idle mode and spend the day sampling inspirations for how Git-Paid will grow the middle class both in the US and in


#### Project Checkin
Thinking about growing Git-Paid and solidfying the foundations for the lab to have tools and services that can be useful and reusable for the next 60 days.

- While it may not make sense to be spending valuable time on things that others are probably better fit and capable to do, I think deliberately building from scratch & with quality allows me to hopefully, maybe by day 80 become a data, dev ops, & full-stack web engineer that can spend the next 20 days applying technical leverage to the problems that feel the most unsettling and therefore being strong motivators.
- While my ability to help build shared context is valuable, per my Product Managment experience, I think leaning in on my Growth & Sales expertise would allow me to supercharge & seed existing efforts and initatives with marketing efficiency & deep integrations with API's & data oracles that can increase top of the funnel traffic that will yield the highest outcome in "Activation" (https://discover.mixpanel.com/rs/461-OYV-624/images/Guidetoproductmetrics-Mixpanel.pdf)

#### Git-Paid
We want to design Git-Paid to function for markets that start their day when we end ours.

India (being just 12 hours ahead) would make an obvious case but I think there's already enough market strength in building economic bridges that can help extend the democratic diplomacy between global markets and ease political tensions where they can and unlock new opportunities to reduce the barrier of high/low context with earned trust & respect.
That beng the case, I thought Taiwan would make for a great pick since it also fits the criteria because 5 PM in Silicon Valley would be 9 AM in Taiwan. Given the importance of the semiconductor supply chain & expertise, I find it imperative to expose their crappiest secret: they create the lowest garbage out of any country in the world!!!!!

#### Check-in on how I'm thinking about the next 41 days
(Day 80, in 41 days, is when highest leverage is; Day 90 is optional reset day)

So, while there are a LOT of ideas and bets that I would like to chase in the interest of Day 1 me and Day 100 us, I want to lean in and double-down on my existing strengths, confidence, & experience to help bring you & the initatives you care about to market, with high customer satisfaction, & shortest time to capturing yield. I owe my maturity & belonging to the developer community that allowed me to remain myself, independent, & authentic in leadership execution & organization. For the products, teams, & problems that mean something to me, I was able to grow into someone I couldnt imagine otherwwise being able to be on my own.

Working on social networks & online communities creates immense leverage in creating efficient markets & highly scalable end-user technologies. I'm hoping this effort becomes a way for me to start building my own & unique principles & ways of operating that is founded upon where my time goes, what I embolden, and what I'm willing to look really silly and deeply sentimanal for. Onwards...   


#### What would failure look like? (Next 41 Days)
1. If by day 50, I haven't yet found a lead for the go-to-market strategy & execution so that I can focus on engineering.
2. If I accept $, personal favors, or prizes for anything. I truly do believe that the most value could be on Day 100 so showing up everyday until then is the only way to actually know what that's like. There is no day 101. I have my own life to live after that and will likely be taking a break from tech
3. Being afraid to go through emotions on both ends in order to progress, transition, and iterate throughout the next 41 days


#### What would failure look like? (Next 9 days)
1. Picking another hypothesis other than Git-Lab to build out the lab
2. Designing the lab for private use. While the outcomes are under my discretion, I would like the mindsets, vision, and attitudes to outlast this initative. The lab should, for the 100 days, be open to public exhibition, participation, & contribution. As to not stress myself out too much, I will limit the visibility & accessibility of the endpoints and configuration parameters so I can spend more time building consumable endpoints & data oracles or external facing functions with secret formulas that are more about creating upside than protecting downside.
3. Not parallellizing the delegation of the operations & communications so I can free up bandwith, energy, & "flow" by being able to be in builder mode all day. Again, Day 80 me should be a Full Stack Data & Web Engineer with a niche focus on tooling, libraries, & design choices that allow me to amplify the other skills, context, & experience I have that can make the process, negotiation, & value alignment much faster, exceptional, and - at times - provisional. I won't be afraid to use my resources & drive to maximize the efficacy of my workflow so I can more work with more consistency with less anti-pattern spikes, deer headlights, and diva moments in the README files. I make things so let's get back to that.
