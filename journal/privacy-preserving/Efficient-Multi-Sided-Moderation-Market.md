### In honest sincerity, I meant to write this as a ploy to paint my "bad boy" image but got slapped with some reality & ripe opportunity to actually make the something the internet could always appreciate: a repeated game of "waste management." I hope you take every analogy made with serious and firm curiosity. It's the Toyota way!

Please be kind! Helps make me more comfortable adding anything. Now let’s start...


# How might the "Wisdom of the Crowd" efficiently contest for maximizing content quality & experience

A set of wisdom to acquire are aligning the incentives, shared possibilities, and a simple formula for customer satisfaction. Let's use Kano - so we are sure there's actionable outcomes.

### Why?
The intelligence of the crowd extends crowdsourcing once the wisdom of everyday users turned Moderators providing direct insight and Moderators maximizing both content, API, & hidden asymmetric advantages to maximize the upkeep required to make the community function. 

(Eventually this strategy is targeted at beyond baseline as a goal; any minute of which is room to invest in educating users & governing the market to equilibrium.)

### Why now?
Still searching for where…

### Objective
For each and every member, it's important - as is said about confidence in a fair opportunity to pursue career & life fulfilment - to be able to dream & work hard to actualize a path of earning & celebrating their respective earnings of fun & lifelong fulfilment. That’s called a community.


#### For us to have actionable outcomes from research that are causally evident as outcome drivers, let's consider Kano as a simple yet robust decision framework.


# What does the crowd see?
Content pipelines are built for consumption by the network and each user requesting from a client; exactly the profile for our soon to be efficient market.

The Moderator has - due soon for long term - greed for the ML models; the market can only chase glory - from customers; and the corporate lawyers are already sweating but opening up the feed too in blissful wonder; policy done just-in-time. 


# Content moderation market -  Maximizing satisfied customers of tomorrow

## Trade-offs
1. The market will assume that information is better sourced from other platforms too because content is likely to be done uniquely
2. The market has to satisfy Moderators aren't biased with any PII or affinity beyond the content
3. The community and Product have to have a Subreddit/Moderator/Site level of cohesion. Without tooling, ownership, & creator conscious product decisions there simply isn't harmony. However, this could be a challenging but rewarding opportunity to build the key foundations on your favorite sites, services, & networks.
4. The Moderator is compensated for offloading the model tuning
5. The Product assumes end-to-end control of the market dynamics but only to maximize the incentives of the customer (the market maker) and the Moderator (market taker), borrowing from market order book concepts.





### What is a content pool?

### Who are the bidders?

### What assymetrical advantages does the market win on rewarding?



### What stages of the market can we expect all the previous market assumptions and dynamics to fail? (WiP)

### What cooperative, above the table, strategies can new players use against the large data sets & highly diverse models? Essentially: fairness.


### What stage do two well fitted models (bidders with task quality heuristic scores) diverge to build a horizontal advantage & growth within specific niches?
(Ex: Recognizing color can be good but detecting red 6x the completion gives you a market. This is also similar to a fork in Git, data structures, and mind maps.)

### How can the players force the Product to pay for cross-platform tunings that otherwise would be absent? What macro-market changes ensue? (2nd & 3rd degree effects elicited to develop a linear narrative that the customer fits in to define the unsaved paths or journeys - UX & execution excellence)

## Measuring metrics for user directed exit paths and entries
(Friendly advice from industry was to use a heuristic where less time is better for bad content; makes sense to any customer)

### How might we be able to reward the Moderators maximizing the metric towards 0?
