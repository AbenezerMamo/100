Knowledge Managment:
1. Going from "knowledge is power" to "sharing knowledge is power"


Knowledge Libraries: https://www.slideshare.net/patrickalfredwaluchio/knowledge-management-and-the-role-of-libraries
1. Going from "ownership" to "access".
2. Going from "just-in-case" to "just-in-time"

What's interesting to me:
1. Focus on 20% of the staff / org that holds 80% of the institutional knowledge that would mitigate the greatest cost to the org's "tacit knowledge" that would otherwise be major opportunity cost
2. Doing 1 should make every new hire 20% more effective - hopefully: if used.
3. Focus on the the middle 60% of the org. Not the top 20% or the bottom 20%. Those already show signals to management on leveling. Hypothesis: unlocking realized impact and motivation from this group could be exponential in value since it should rejuvenate and amplify not only their own goal-attainment-drive but their immediate team and project
4. Collect private and anon info on breakups, personal loss, and periods of change from employees to help flag "internal counsel" to provide some massaging while remaining neutral between the org and the employee; reporting only to the board
5. Entrust young people to curate, ideate, and improv the trust & incentive models/frameworks that can easily abstract to the intimacy and scrappiness required to apply it to a small team (<= 12 )

Side note: it's a Silicon Valley thing to start incorporating the moment you find a cool number or Latin phrase. Next it's colors. Oh. Damn. Nicki!!!!!!
