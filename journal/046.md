# Sunday April 25th, 2021

Today is a new day; an earned opportunity as the fruit of chances taken yesterday; and a black swan's feather that will be the clues for how Covid-19 has and will continue to reshape our habits, behavior, and expectations. Increasingly worried about how little I'm aware of in regards to market shifts, media:public relationship, and the role of politics and religion both micro and macro level. I am to pray everyday but it's been months if not over a year since I've been to church. It's also been a while since I got into a political argument and another long while since I've gotten comments about my cursing so I'm still trying to play the same songs. The trick here is that as you age and keep yourself the same, you find that the world sees you as a man child. Welcome to my world. Today, we're working backwards to Day 50 and creating value that would be a high leverage value prop for someone to handle everything but eng so i can focus on that. Updates later....


# Git-PAID!
By Day 50, it would be nice to have both an API, Github, & live-stream (Twitch as of now) that facilitate both consumption & creation). Admin tools are kind of fuzzy right now but I think I'm actually making good headway on understanding auth end-to-end so I think building for anonomized sessions and users would simply just be a gateway issue. Which....I am still indecisive about managed or not. TBD later...
