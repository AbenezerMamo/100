# Recover

The importance of recovering what you lost:

1. Creating new work will have equal, hopefully greater, weight in accruing value and meaning that can be derived from what is already known to what could soon become
2. Taking your creativity seriously requires cherishing the rough and messy beginnings that remind us to never shun being silly and playful in our creative conquests
3. Just like a pet, a child, or a streak: creativity is a fragile, naive, & yearning wonderer that can easily get lost in our interpretations of duality in the world. For the slightest of changes, irregularities, and unfamilarity of the paths around, in front, and unbenounced could be a road to never be defrosted; no matter how warm our gesture 
4. Greatest work is one that invites another; a day, among, & along the way
5. The beautiful & mezmorizing animations that whirl around a file and a folder as you add another only get more satisfying at O(N) the # of items in the file-system (I had to!)
6.
