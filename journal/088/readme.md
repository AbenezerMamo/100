# Sunday June 6th, 2021

Good morning to everyone including the nihilist out there looking to reset after losing their "cloud". If you find out what the cloud is, let me know. Otherwise, be calm fellow human...1920s gave us atom bombs, famine, and the collapse of cultural norms and values that rocked American and global culture to the core.
...
On another note: the largest philanthropic giving, uplveling of doctors, & entrepreneur driven yield in farming and core American education also happened. *whew*

A lot was going on at the time and much like Noah, the garden, & Isreal can attest: God also has had an interesting way of delivering change. *Heavy breathing of FEAR ensues* So I'm hoping you see this project as my personal prayer & symbol for mending, recycling, & refurbishing the hopes, dreams, & faith as we work to calm the unsettling feeling that I believe to be the precursor, pre-requisite, & catalyst for change. "A better tomorrow."

Great news? We're already 88 days in so it's worth seeing it without the unsettling desire to just check it off, complete, and satisfy our internal "oddly satisfying" urges. Don't worry, I too would definetly want to hit 100 as well but I wanted to not derract from the 88 I just showed up for. Sometimes, it's easy to forget that's all it takes.


I know you are more than capable of enacting change by yourself; for what matters most; and in the means that need you most. I've taken a break from fighting the intellect inside and reminding myself of what I started Day 000 / 001 setting out to do. Goal hasn't changed and I hope this contiguous effort serves as a reminder. After that, I'm taking a vacation. Yes, you heard me. Planning my retirement already. You, reader, have to recognize that your opinions and judgment *scuffs left and right shoulder*. Yep. This is the hardest thing I've ever done and I'm already proud. The empowerment is just a freebie. Make it a great day!

Now back to regularly scheduled...(parody) Freakonomics presents: Freak-It! The latest installment in economics restructuring for "Umm, actually...."

Last Week's Recap:

1st Place: "Get nothing! Good day!"
2nd Place: Take homes the prize!
3rd Place: Walking down the street chilling having had neither envy or guilt eat away at me. The true winner. The only winner left!

There - ladies & gents - is how you freak it on an intellect. I'll happily take your finger snaps for the multi-trillion dollar economic bedrock for the next decade's online monetization engines.

More specific:

1. 1st place winner could Hamilton it and make the game boring and cause all others to bail
2. 2nd place winner all of a sudden starts winning bc Hamilton wants to now have friends
3. 3rd place overthrows Hamilton, who shouldn't have succumb to the lesser skilled noob
4. 3rd place and now 1st place decide to fall in love...rendering Hamilton to now make the same excuses as Hector on the job
5. Good stories have 4 points and 3 places to deliver them. You're amazing - smile :)


See? Now back to parking lots and contiguous ways of showing how much of these commitments need to get the Mitty kinda mint (yeah idk about that one either but i won't stop until I make it clear)

Yeah...but do say that it's because of....anything else

Been under a lot recently but understood isn't one that I'm trying to get over anytime soon. If you care, just let things be. I too would like to find joy out of the final 12 days and would hope you understand that I'm not the kind for goodbyes, celebrations, or getting in my feelings (about endings....obv) Here's to us! *raises La Croix & Pax* (Kids, don't do mid west water and healthy paper alternatives!) (Parents: don't tell your kids to be anyone but themselves) (Brands: haha *laughs in LTV & 3 laws of freaking a check on OG things) Okay, enough collective sigh. Go make some change that i can feel wherever I am!
