Welcome to a new day; here's an opportunity. Relax, it's okay you don't need to keep stunting that you can use a dictionary too. Ahem. Quotes - whoops. Ahem. What a chance to live for what we want to champion :)

God willing I hope to be left alone by all of the Bible and history, in equally void of anything but * talking. Which I mean...you got the 1st and the 5th on. God is good! Make it a good one y'all. For the rest of you, turn up for the rest of us


You never really know these days. Goes from salvaging equilibriums- ahem: providing the short squeeze equivalent for behavioral economics -- and making sure to destroy (too much goody-shoe stinking up my game) only as much as I'm willing to stretch a band aid. (there should really be a letter before the h in my opinion)

Also, 1,000x so.....cut straight to the paper chase with no band- aid. *skateboard smacking the air in VTOL brushes* I've been perfecting that one for a while now. The other economists get credibility, paid, and freak it on a book. Don't worry, I've already cemented my place in the history books so swiveling tables need not swivel. Good night!
