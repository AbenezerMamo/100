Not even the length of a foot. Make it a good day!

# Dear Diary

My 1st ever encounter with brazen discrimination while booking a stay at Inn@Market with AirBnb. For once, tech money & influence cracked through a marketplace. When it happens, I will call you out on it. It's prime real estate and I'm sure money with better morals and values can find it more hospitable.

I worked a block away at Twitter for years and I expect better. Will not regret letting you know I am human too.
