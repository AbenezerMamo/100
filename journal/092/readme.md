Not even the length of a foot. Make it a good day!

# Dear Diary

My 1st ever encounter with brazen discrimination while booking a stay at Inn@Market with AirBnb. For once, tech money & influence cracked through a marketplace. When it happens, I will call you out on it. It's prime real estate and I'm sure money with better morals and values can find it more hospitable.

I worked a block away at Twitter for years and I expect better. Will not regret letting you know I am human too.

# Hiring

Min Req:
1. 1 Year off weed
2. Background check
3. Treat yourself on your own dime

In other news, NBC inspires a generation of comedians entering the new age civic duty.

# Firing

When a customer fires you, the remaining ones raise their price in response & because you're now going to do what ever they demand because they are all you have left.

In fact, because they've held out for so lomg...they could be extra extra needy and could pay 10x more for what meets their taste and pallate. God forbid they shared more than customer service privilage. Welcome to the economy of a small business. In case you forgot the pioneers who bet big on their hearts & loyal customers.

# Promoting

The best reward for your employees is the feeling of pride in what they could command to the liberty of service & care. That is what makes a business a true art. All the burden & tribulatons of each moment open all ends with the team getting together to celebrate and close the day off over food, drinks, and a good laugh.

The tears shed each closing hour is for the dreams they chase, not the bottom line or logo on their shirt. As a business owner, you are responsible for funding that dream responsibly & honorably. If not, the market is hungry for talent looking to win together.

# Fruit Stands

Very happy not lawyer leveraging FDIC insured services that move swiftly across the system. A reminder to us all that fiat onramps for your newly minted coin right off the mining press needs to be propogated across the system. Yep, there are fruit stands unmanaged in banking. Just loan me $50M to innovate in each state and I'll show you a pipeline the DHS will bless. The rest thought a family office was the outcome. God will avenge me defending Uncle Sam. I don't even have kids man...
