# Saturday April 17th, 2021

Today is a new day; an opportunity; today's onus to  be yesterday's tomorrow.

Today is a day of rest so I hope to find comfort in having a REST end point for auth up soon.
Then it's on to some testing.

Valve time is set as my internal clock.
 
 
 ##### Time traveled 22 hours into the future to come back to change the day to Saturday. False alarm, three day weekend mandate was the cake. Now back to Sunday...
