# Deliberately practicing
1. Ask what you're going to do different next time
2. Each try should be like your very last. Don't forget it takes more wins to come back from 1 loss
3. Stretch but don't let it turn into Stratechry level business and market analysis. Stretch goals but always remember to want nothing.
