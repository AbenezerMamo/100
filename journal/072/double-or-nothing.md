# Is this for you, is it you, and or is it just you being...?

Doesn't matter what you want to call it or what you believe it to be earned, nurtured, or acquired but I think it's the "hidden requirement" that makes the chances we take much more of a "they did the math" kind of risk.

Generally, I've been struggling to not learn the same lessons over and over again. Waiting until I felt like I was somebody to do something is the biggest one. I imagine if you've been home for quite some time, you'll find that you are not you when you are alone or....not alone. Welcome to the world of having adult friends who act like teenage rebels and teenage rebel friends who think adults aren't shit. Don't test the depth of free time, "oh yeah...", and *hold this* actually, it's on me! I heard you have to double down or else you can't make it in standup. So I just show up and hold it down. This is why you're told that you should write for your audience and not for yourself.

There will always be people who seek to build a life for a complex yet astonishingly juvinile joke. I wanted one to widthstand the test of 100 years of digital and IRL stunting. I got * you skills, and these patties are tripple double like it was OCK MVP season. So remember: I made * rich before I got comfortable with my crypto gains. When you make it:

1. Have people celebrate you on the way up
2. Bet on yourself and invest in life long continuous learning
3. Bet on the friend you feel will one day create the community you wish to be part of
