One of the things I'll forever be greatful for is the having had the opportunity as a 19 year old to leave home and find myself in Silicon Valley to spend an entire year testing the depth, grace, & affordance of God's love and my eventual conclusion: yes, I am indeed a Christian.

That comes with the following questions being answered. If you're not familiar, I'm sorry in advance:

1. Can I smoke weed and drink and still be a Christian?
2. Do I really have free will in this world or does God already know what is going to happen?
3. If I have free will, doesn't that mean that others also have free will?
4. If what I need tomorrow is already figured out, does it imply that tomorrow exists or do I have the choice, will, & opportunity to be there?
5. If I could lose today as much this second as the 23rd hour, 59th minute, and 58th second....does that mean I too have the free will to stay and go?
6. If God has other kids he likes here too, doesn't that mean they too have the same rights as I do?
7. If all it takes is to believe, then why do I need to go the extra mile to be nice just to end up in the same Apple line in heaven? (sorry, had to...)
8. If my Christianity is of will and just as mine to decide against or not at all, then why shouldn't I treat the ones that I'm supposed to be here to evangelize to the same way as any other being?
9. If tomorrow is mine to choose and I would like to ask for it as much as I can be graced by it, then why wouldn't I see my desire to not lose it on my own be an opportunity for me to be something more than just for myself?
10. If there's nothing more for me to ask God of in this life, then what does it say about the chances that I take in this world?

Make it a good day! Levelsetting here to make sure we both have expectations of the conditions that matter clear. This way we can both act on behalf of our own accord having laid out what we each can at least make a promise to do. If I don't show up, (condition), it's because there was something more important (outcome). The only failure condition was to accept any other prize than the one at the finish line and to just show up for 100 Days to reward no one but the Day 1 version of me that dared to believe in us so that we show up each day and the next but not 1 more than the last day we consecutively show up for. The only clown to show up to 101 is a class act.
