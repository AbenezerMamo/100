Today is a new day; an opportunity; and a chance to still do something before 4 turns to 3. Wait. *Kyrie hesi step engages*


# Dear Diary

Decision Systems:
Which plan & mundane decisions and data (knowledge) visualizations would serve the co-signer or "Approver" (DACIN) w/ the right amount of context that can either

1. > Autonomy for subjective interpretation
2. < Cognitive load per element, key, & respective information hierarchy
3. - Guide & zoom into points of interest
	-	Points of intersection, trend change, & delta
	-	Units of measure
	-	Optimistic or runoff forecasts & scale transpositions
		-	Imagine the known data to be within the graph; unknown (future) to be extending out of the graph; and the past (ahdere to standards of a "Record") leading into the starting point or axis

The context for this idea / hypothesis is in remembering the times at Snapchat where my onboarding into the org and the problem space was through a forcing function that I now better appreciate: presentations to the suits. There's the eng director / vp who would show up once a week to hear about how the Filters are doing in the market (both organic & promoted). So I would compile a report for the week with stats, previews, & prompt for conversation so that I'm able to help build confidence & credibility for my work, project objectives, and performance evaluations.

This is interesting example because usually we have lots of talented data science, product marketing, & finance teams that we rely on for defining the way we frame, communicate, & provision the information that can be used by anyone to argue for or against something. Generally, the PM with data, customer evidence, & forums for critique will be unstopable. Now, make those look pretty and you'll be a newly exec; now you can go do the same thing for the board. Learning how to manage up is high leverage in any role. Never make the people that bet on you look stupid. The better you understand how your boss and peers are being evaluated, the easier it'll be to uplevel them so they can more quickly get to the next stage; opening the doors for you to earn your place in the team, not just a replacement.

As my mentor once told me: "you'll only be here once and certainly so with the same people; working on the same thing; and having been the same person". Or something along those lines. After that conversation, I decided I'm going to enjoy the heck out of what I do and I've never been the same since. So do your job like you're courting it. Fall in love with a font or two. Fall in love with the formatting. Fall in love with the beauty that is timeseries data. Ummm.....gonna need some space now. *opens new tab* (I aspire to live more lavish & longer than my browser cache)

But since I'm on the topic of stunning on you with brand names: I would love to dedicate an honor to Snap for my vulgar language. I was tasked with creating the ban word filter list and some of the font negotitations. So...trust me when I say that my role is unique in having given me incredible breadth and really appreciate how dedicated & talented the village is that touches every single project. But more importantly: I get to learn all the cool & fun parts about their job & craft that helps make it fun & envigorating decades into it. So I would love to lean into my experience working on consumer monetization to be able to help make these tools work & fit the complex needs of largely cross-functional organization structures & business constraints.
