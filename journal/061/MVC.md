What's a great way to not get stuck at the same PM level? Insult all your PM bossess with an MBA b/c a16z. Now, let's get back to the main directive...

# Model
1. Bulk ad creation (allows us to leverage the breadth in the segmentation of the end product that we use in marketing to help us leverage creative & copy permutations as well as the A/B tested direction on the value prop that works) [My Ampush PM Internship working on FB Ads Creation tool is the reason why I hate spreadsheets, macros, & generally anything related to tabs or commas :) ]
2. Finance / audit / compliance records can filter for the most important, tangible, & transformative units of measure [When I worked in ads, we obviously treat consumer events/metrics differently from monetization/revenue ones]
3. If you plan to exercise your right to bare arms, I suggest heading over to your local police station to the respective registration required in your state. After, you'll find your info propogated across FBI, municipal, DHS, & emergency records. This is awesome because anyone that may need to know how to act and behave in accordance to your personal choices can do so without making you feel at odds. While I don't believe in guns nor would I ever intend on using one, I think it's cool to highlight how beneficial, really empowering, & reassuring it is that information can appropriately be turned into intelligence depending on the needs & use cases for the people who will use it to make decisions. I am not yet ready to touch medical related analogies so my knowledge of the justice system & civic infra will do for now. So please stop getting arrested for unregistered weapons; I need hype music. It helps you in my opinion to leverage this if you were previously detered by the "big brother" feel of it before. Wait until I tell you about why you should get your valuables itemized...(Buffet hates him.) 
4. ETF registeration filings that the SEC requires upfront. These are easily the most you'll get to see into how portfolio managment & financial hedging works in respect to people, financers, & people who expect results from you. "You do what you want when you're profitable" - ....
