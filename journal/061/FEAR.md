# If I could roll up this data into a single record.....

Are you ready to accept this challenge?
1. "On your mark....."
2. Getters? Setters?

"Why not both?" Seriously. Airtable has the right idea.

Since 1945 (as per the Atlantic article I shared a while back that I'm still reading), we haven't moved the needle that far in human computer interaction. We're still using it as a input device and hoping the information it gathers can now-adays learn its way into intelligence. Let's try again. What if we generate NEW DATA with the time, entries, & relations that begin to accrue with each addition?

FEAR.
1. Of what you won't be able to control the narrative of...
2. Of what you won't get to limit the spread of...
3. Of what you won't be able to align everyone on towards the latest of...
4. Of what happens when you try to collide the smallest representation of the data on hand...(You can thank Rockafellar for having taken notice in 1920s and inspired a generation of civic venturists that can inspire optimism & faith in the collective, tomorrow, & the best version of us we can become)

So, what is my fear? Zero budget. I say we make budget.
