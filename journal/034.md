As of now-ish, today is a new day; opportunity to earn the day: and a chance to work with romantic vigor. In homor of the special person who helped me see just how much love I was capable of giving. I hope you can awaken and rejuvinate from the continued mission. Hoping to raise the bar a bit for how much tangible work i produce. That means you should expect even less polish & edit in favor of active thought streams on topics and concepts in each day's log so it's a scrarchpad you can use as context. I don't expect its contents to represent me beyond the same day. I will continue on git-paid bc it seems impactful. For variety, will finally start Wallet mocks
