Today is a newly minted Day. It's of rare value and in prestine condition. It's part of the early collection in the 100 Day contiguous time series. What makes this is a worthwhile opportunity is its possibility of transending today as a vehicle for leveraged equity for others: a chance for change.

Make it a great day!
