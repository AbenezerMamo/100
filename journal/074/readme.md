# Sunday May 23rd, 2021

Today is a newly minted Day. It's of rare value and in prestine condition. It's part of the early collection in the 100 Day contiguous time series. What makes this is a worthwhile opportunity is its possibility of transending today as a vehicle for leveraged equity for others: a chance for change.

Make it a great day!

# I got the need, the need to build something you don't want

It's okay, the YC conflict runs too deep to even start so let's commence:

Hey, Abe here. Let's take a look at that 90% default rate...sorry that's settings. Let's get back to cars

1. Home, education, cars (biggest purchases in your life ranked)
2. Unlike your home, your car generally falls more in line with a 7 year ARM financing than a 30 year fixed rate. Which is 4x as long for context.
3. When you're 28, you might think about purchasing a home since you're done with your Romeo thing and wrap up your 7 years of hustle 21-28. Too advanced for us
4. Let's say at ~30 you put a rock on it, and then decide to rock a FB signing bonus grossed-up on it (everyone in finance & recruiting hates him!) and put $100 bands on that FHA loan you're gonna stay a year at. For interest rates that high, you better have figuerd out how to pay back the principle before you get your attention some mentions. So you're gonna likely pay off that house by 60.
5. So you're 60 now and the C8 just got some head space, front splitters that still look like they're there, and golf bags. So you're gonna get the Senna or Toyota van at 67 once you're done paying that off
6. Hi there, don't mean to scare you but you're 2 years away from being considered "vintage" so don't get mellow on us man...just jump at the current opportunity to knick away at your bucket list
7. So now you're here today. Look left and right before you cross the buy and sell walls because Elon's next short squeeze won't be so friendly if you already know how to handle your wealth from this magical quarter (25 Days left soon) so now you can be okay with your Tesla appreciating your values and morals. Also, it's worth more now!!! But the $ per kw/h is like 1/10 (~$100) what is used to be so in 10 years, I imagine maybe $50-$75 would be a good target to aim for so that the biggest cost of the car can be cut in half and now the new one has more storage and faster speeds. *Tim and Steve shake in unison*
8. Congrats, welcome to America. The not #1 car market in the world b/c that one has 4x the population size.....and a higher band for the middle class to grow. Also what EV incentives? *shrug*
9. Hi, round furniture here: *sips: see nobody cares* Yeah, maybe you shoud definetly try charging incentives once you run out of refunds. Some of us have been having a hard time dealing with all this cashless & oil wealth thing....Can't imagine some dude in the 1920s having 90% of America's oil so gotta make sure we keep it kosher with capitalism
10. Hi, 2008 here: Just don't try to build synthetic markets on top of things that are already having Elon start lucid dreaming he could get some breahing space too. Oh, yeah relax we're good. Just make sure you learn to put a lens on to the hard truths that give us more confidence if anything...Just don't mail it and exxcept me to not flex my wealth and be like: *throws away bank's 4 page letter:* *Tasha*

Okay. Whew. I needed all that b/c yeah I don't drive hommie so relax, I'm trying to make sure you feel comfortable with globalism. They saw 50 years on the top charts and thought the Model E was a joke hahaha! He's just after the Texas Edition badges too man. Lucky for us, we got some Henny doing work on that truck so whatever that torque or sweet pony stats are.....too fast....too high....*Stars to sweat in 71 metals*

Cheers,
Da Auto Fan

*Ahem* Tata motors does Office style celebrations for the mobility in your price Range. Sheeshhh....imagine if I told them they just needed to make the car go fast hahah *laughs in capital*
