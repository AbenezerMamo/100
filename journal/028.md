Today is a new day; an opportunity; and an invitation to "experiri' - "I try; I experience; I do" 

I'd like for you to consider "sperare" as the guiding North Star for how we carry ourselves; represent our teams; and recycle communal resources. This word represents the hope we can enstill in those we embolden; a bar of which the duality of our intentions and actions will produce in the world continuously. In that glow, we can instill confidence and courage in explorers as we - per the 2nd definition of the word - to trust. That trust is engraved as "In God We Trust"; and you can put a price on that - a whole $100 bill. With time I hope to grow comfort being vulnerable to embrace my greed and selfishness for this project. God bless America. I gotta bounce before the 4th of July because the temporal nature of my energy is why I only hope that you bring this project anew.
