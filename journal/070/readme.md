# Wednesday May 19th, 2021

I am so excited for all that you will get to appreciate from what is Day 2/3 on my cool-down days to make sure I am choosing to show up for the reasons that align with Day 1 me. So 3 days to just start with showing up are my go-to to pretty much see if I can still buy it; a.k.a “has it been at least 3 times? or is it just….aspirational”. If you have never heard: I never get fired; I quit. History is told by the victors and thos that show up for no other prize than Day 100. Never by those who make things and get deeply sentimental in the process. Can you imagine now why I don’t even hesitate to tell you how amazing it is to dream with people? Except you know…when they all catch feelings because you also can’t imagine why wouldn’t also do well on the other inteviews. I waited this long so let me now shove it to my boss who dared to tell me that I have to form a point of view to convey an argumentative writing style that can uplevel 1-Pagers for the next kid who breaks my 1 year and 8 months record. Speaking of 2 years, here’s some wisdom before I get deep into my feelings…

2 year is a great cycle to aim for before thinking in orders of magnitude more

1. 2 Years
    1. Go study something new or start a new (ad)venture. I swear to you I got offended when my mentor suggested I be reasonable and aim to negotiate my comp on time scales I can achieve *gulp* Sigh….
    2. Not gonna give anyone crap but if I have to it’ll be in public: you will want to grow and do well if your boss’s boss happens to also be your mentor. I swear to you: through nails, teeth, & having something to look forward to scheduled in advance so I can get through a tough week (advice I once got too).
    3. On that note, I can never tell you how hard it has been for me to be this loud when all the people that I’m supposed to be embodying are too damn chill. OMG!!!! The things I do so you too can keep being authentic. Please be kind and realize that we all want to see the pool get bigger for diverse talent so it’s important that you try to stay 2 years so the entire market can create pressure for academia and industry to train and uplevel fresh talent. PM thing was just in the AM for me. Excited and hyped for all of you to now show black excellence your own way. Cheeers!
2. To make #3 work for whatever you want to represent, try to help craete opportunity for us to measure your growth and mastery in the scope of 2 years. The accountability systems that the Department of Education, district level k-12 evaluations , and apprentenship accreditation efforts are trying to align on a time scale to measure the changes that aligns with your performance, prospects, and pace. To help them make your poise and resilliance through the hardest transition in education history not go in vein, help make your transition towards tomorrow a step function improvement for the kids of tomorrow who will never get to know and experience the “simple times” of the wheels squeeking as the TV rolls into the room….*turns towards anyone and everyone in bliss* & then the importance of the outfit that will shape your future - same bro, same. TL;DR: You can’t take the journey to the desination if you can’t calibrate your telemetry with the nearby landmarks and other sensors that require you to learn how to navigate new terrains in exploring the magic of a trust fall; gum; and pinkie promise. You got this! 
3. How long it’ll take to build ncome history that will help underwriters consider your bonus and equity as additional income you can use to show momentum shifts in your life. I want you to celebrate being a home owner early as you dream a magical wedding and parenthood with your own so you can grow with them too.
4. Growing with your partner and with your future own requires you to decide to choose change, live change(d),  and be a catalyst of as a service of: the kinds of problems that yield step function up-leveling we can feel around us.

All-In:
1. People cared before you
2. People will care that you cared enough to live with the duality of just focusing on their own respective thing "in service of" of the village (Pale Blue Dot) will feel the shared wisdom all around them in transient bliss short enough to service the exellence that embodies excellence in craftable ingenuity, secrets, and fostering the common good with a f*ck you attitude to win as a team - together.
3. People will care after. For the following reasons:

While at liberty & self-selective will, the stages of life we know and sprout for our own - near and far - will grow trees of shared autonomy wherever the fruits of their labor begin to "bloom" seeding a global village.

For the thugs in this paradise chase to be global citizens to earn the "feeling of home" whever it finds them in love, celebration, & passage. Diginfied lifelong learning & yearning for excellence and happiness is how you can keep “calm, cool, and collected” as we make way for the new. In each incounter, another unconditional grace of life, we can have once in a life time moments that are timeless shared celebrations of what we feel around us. So that it may help you embody the importance of - as President Kennedy dared to advance - understanding the power and love of "choosing to give life over taking one."

Thank you: I am more than happy to have bden the benefitary of such freedoms for explorers like me. To now and as long as I'm able to: have the wisdom to fear, love, & believe.

To me: it could just have been anybody and it didn’t have to be me. If I care, I want it to do it in a way that makes it feel pallatable for me, outlives my browser’s tabs, and I can be proud to tell my very own. There’s more to take in than you can create and more you can create than you can take in. So relax, life is good :) “Don’t gas me up” *Lil Boat take mixed with Jim take mixed with Kyrie post-game*

Like MKBHD says about being high definition: “be the best - period; not best……" [insert here anything but '.'] Doing should naturally inspire and captivate the world all around us with sweetness and smile from the freedoms their name will earn for all they choose to stand - and up - for. So I'm showing up for 100 days to see what it is happens if you just show up so people can celebrate you on the way up; never feel too far removed to appreciate to ask for help; and so people know you would are getting better so they too can experience better from what you share - better together.

Like your mom - and decider of the fate of persinalized education & dating in localized everywhere context; ahem - would remind you: grow imto a gift to the world with what you create, buy-in, and show up for; day to day.

For all that we can't, we celebrate those who do. While you redefine stunting the world of your game:
1. Enjoy some hype music, art, & things that you can be in awe of for inspiration (nature is good to start, keep moving and breathing, and extend a hand)
2. Pay it forware to what you will: a shared unity indivisible in "linage" and loyalty to where we find belonging so we protect through service the freedoms, support systems, & rights that are collectively and uniquely shared through our children's sweetness felt all around us.
3. Take pride in showing up. It starts with a second; a chance to be the first of a new life where now is as good a time as any to travel to the future and bring back the you that you would wish for yourself to actualize for those to feel all round them

For I am just as willful in the tug of war that is selfishness and selflessness; through autonomy and free will; like brother and sister. Love is a choice and I recently learned the importance of seeing joy in a life that is lived exclusively thriugh the choices made than those we don't.

For you, I can be more than i can for myself and that's what gives me hope that you can see more in yourself through those that you change for. You can’t change anyone and change is something that starts with you obviously but it starts when you believe that I can feel it all around me too. What you get to see: how much more you’re capable of love, care, and understanding than you ever thought was possible through your eyes, ears, or imagination; as I had wished for myself as I start the last 30 days.
