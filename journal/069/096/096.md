# Internet's middle child: zMillenial (96)

Only graduated my 23 so I'm 24 doing Jack knows what; 0.0 takes every cycle (7), & 168 Hours which is 1 hour shy of a 69 joke. 144 if God wants to take his humor a break. 120 if you take 2 days or a weekend off. Which is like dragging each hour like a day 2x 60 min. What do the numbers mean...nothing it's not even real...no key or value just an index saying "you da man!"

I swear they were so close to all 10 free days. They would soon realize the true challenge was making friends along the way because you would want to win so much only you remembered to keep working 9 days past everyone else's cloud; the cloud ends at 9 for the 6 rollers
