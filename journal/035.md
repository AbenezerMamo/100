Today is a new day; an opportunity; and a chance of a lifetime.

I like the momentum from yesterday but worry that I'm allocating a ton of time into one thing. Because I'm already so far ahead, might as well extend the goal to having something usable by Friday EoD (really going to flex how end of the day it is haha).
Today's likely some more infra work but client work isn't forgotten.
