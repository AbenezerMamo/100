Today is a new day; an opportunity; and a chance to empower my creativity by creating unique space for it within a cohesive mission. 

Given the amount of bandwidth required to execute on all these hypothesis, I thought it would be best to graduate them into their own repo hosted by 1092 Labs. These are meant to house the much more verbose and iterative efforts that will continue to be open source but may open doors for more tight-nit collaboration that's sharing in resources and brainpower.
More importantly, this allows me to maintain the creative freedom and intellectual curiousity to bridge between subjects and dig deep in order to kick-start some actual building. The first one will be Bricolage (research, analysis, & shared canvas). First objective is to build on mind / concept maps with a fun twist to make being creative a state of mind; and certainly not an attribute.
We'll see how this goes.
