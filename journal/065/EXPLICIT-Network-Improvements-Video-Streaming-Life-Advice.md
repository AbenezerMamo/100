# I don't last as long as the porn video so please stop wasting valuable bandwidth and network throughput

Whew. I told myself that I will be a living legend if I grow the heart to say this. I honestly think given the usage data on porn sites, we'll likely be saving anywhere from 1-5% at least in bandwidth being saved, cache being freed, and content creation to respond and adapt to this very sudden and jarring phenomena.

In all seriousness, I always found it odd that you feel so dirty, horrible, disgusted, & errked out after you finish; you probably don't even finish the video. That's kind of the point.....You can't finish many times in a row and your body has naturally given you a system delay that's intended to make sure the mother of your children, delicate companion, & relationship survival are looked out for from the monster that is your horniness. I like to say you because I'm also errked out and feel personally attacked too.

What's even better? Imagine being alive in a time where people would consider you to be more than mortal (*gulp* this is not what I condone and hence why I choose my words. *ahem*) and you had a highly complex, intricate, and chiseled statue of you...with a small tiny penis. Don't you find it jarring with the 8 pack abs? Why do you think that is?

What do you make of that in an era of "big d*ck energy"??? What do you think they were trying to tell us about being erect, horny, & thrill-seeking? Hmm...idk.

From one bro to another: find a substitute for your depression, suppressed desires, and addiction coping mechanism or else you're going to

1. Porn does NOT equate to making love
2. Humans don't like to be treated like you see in porn
3. You have to clean up after
4. You will have the head of your penis lose sensitivity over time and you'll rob yourself out of actual pleasure
5. Your girl will be sad that you can't put in more effort for her. Try breathing, jazz, & controlling your muscle contractions. You might be flexing a muscle too hard. Also, forgive yourself. It's okay. I gochu.
6. Porn has been around longer than this metal glass thing has. Humans have desires and they need to be met.
7. Do not think that you're above anything. When you're in love, you will do whatever love warrants
8. The sooner you can realize that the woman/men gender ratio is more even than you think in porn, you'll come to appreciate gaming
9. If you show your lady love, care, & attention...it'll pay dividends. So be honest and ask for advice. You getting better is you both enjoying it more. That's maturity.
10. Finally: the internet, VR, & video streaming technology advanced because of porn. In fact, the best video technology engineers all work for them
11. Porn has sh*t ads b/c they're not brand safe. So they're mostly owned by one giant company b/c that's the only way you can make ad deals and contracts that make it easy to fund it.
12. I tell my girl every-time I jerked off and it's made our relationship about that much much more better. It's embarrassing but I found the honesty to be worth the shame. So if you plan on getting into VR, kindly let your partner help you not ruin your love life. If you need to ask me why then you're not the person I care about helping with this page.
13. Please do not let the next generation go through the suffering I and many others did. What's wrong with you guys? Why didn't any of you say something???!!? Are you stupid? Do you know how much I would have appreciated you?!! Geez....Let's grow up and look out for each other's best interest. So.....make sure you can have this convo with a sibling if you can, a best friend, or just find a forum like all the 90s kids. Seriously, reach out and you'll find that people can see your vulnerability kindly and won't make you feel ashamed.
14. Stop thinking your penis size matters. I mean, it has no value if you can't last bruh. So....also consider that your goals, motivation, & desire to go through "power process" are likely affected by your penis. Because I know nothing of the science, I'd advise you ask your doctor. If you still think hiding things from your doctor isn't shooting yourself in the foot, try again. Who else are you gonna ask for help???
15. Please don't shame anyone. You have no right to. You will never understand true love until you realize that sex and love making come secondary to wanting to make yourself better so your partner can experience and be-with better.



There are a lot of bold, courageous, & mid-night risks I've taken in my life for "the collective common good" and this about blows them all away. See, I didn't even take the bait on that one b/c I want you to see how much I'm willing to look silly, stupid, or lose social capital to make sure you don't go through the same suffering (or hopefully someone you didn't think would need it).

If this is all it takes to make sure at least 1 couple have a better marriage, intimacy, & dignity, then I'm happy to oblige. The only person feeling shamed and bad will be you if you think I'm not proud of how much I've grown and matured to be able to get to this point. I love you mom/dad, yene fikir, & future-but-now-never ladies and I'm so so sorry! You're welcome other parents!
