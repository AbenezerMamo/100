# Leveraging productivity yield as a lever to 1,000x the GDP within the 100 Days

I had to quickly shift to some credible & tangible intellectutal stimulation after that last commit. Let's begin: (please correct me if I say something false, misguided, or plain wrong)

### Growth Levers
1. Wages (this can be hard to understand b/c of how much the location, lifestyle, & policy can affect this)
2. Cost of producing services and goods (over time, this should decrease but scarce resources are an exception)
3. Productivity (...)
4. Demand (this increasing or decreasing can be huge but this should move with wages. Supply can hurt this obv.)
5. Supply (rarely does over supply happen but if it does it's because the cost of producing has gone down and all else stable)

### Enumerating questions
1. What is productivity in a labor market?
2. If productivity tools exist and there's a huge self-help market, then why doesn't the economy have one too?
3. Why aren't we as workers incentivized to improve our productivity if it directly improves yield?
4. How does technology & globalism impact the non-uniform-distribution nature of the internet, digital access, & symboiosis with the real world? (inspired by article I read about this in NYT recently)
5. What if we assume that we don't want to be productive at all?
6. Can we simulate the outcomes of productivity changing in each region, market, & industry using agent modeling?
7. Why is there not a taxonomy of what this means in each economy? (Bankok & Addis Abebba have huge outdoor markets and the stats on who is registered, taxed, accounted for, & even licensed will blow you away)
8. How does productivity change in a world that's got kids wanting to make open source profitable?
9. How does productivity change if you're a kid who gets measured on the outcomes of the work and not the actual work? What about every 3 months? What if you have to define the measures yourself....
10. If OKRs have .5-.7 as a healthy range for success, then why are we aiming to make productivity go towards 1.0 or 100%? Okrrrrrrrrrrr ;)
11. What if you win $4 at 7-11? How do you stay productive, motivated, & remain faitful to the game, hussle, & Day 1 hype music?


This is what happens when I try to cover my b.s. or shame.....Rockafella would be proud. Wait until I tell you what I did to make sure my memory didn't fail me when I found my way to the  5th largest economy at the age of 20....You know who will hate me? I mean hopefully I care enough to be comfortable with my vice, sins, & "growth" so that I can bridge the generations equally. I mean, trust me.....I'm so scared for these kids and elders that I am just hoping to muster up courage bit by bit each day. We'll see how today goes....

### Next Step
1. Begin a tutorial on how to use agent modeling to help work towards solutions for prodcutivity, infectous disease spread, & forest fires. (I promise on my life that it's only b/c I want to make sure that I don't do anything if it's not truly coming from my heart. I'm too ashamed of how much time has gone by already but now is as good a time as any)
