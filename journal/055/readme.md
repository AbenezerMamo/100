Let's jump right into it:
(Continuation from 054)

CRUD Permutations on existing file systems

1. Create new file as admin and allow editors to edit readme.txt and Update file type to .md to approve. Thereafter, everyone should be able to see the changes in markdown and magic index routing (index.php or app.js are other examples)
2. Cron job doing a rebase periodically until the service has found a better directory to prune or simply remain idle to clean up indexing, searching, and cache
3. The waiting game. Just hope you design your interesting model accounting for my lightning fast hard refresh spam. Maybe save the entire web a 1% less reloading. How am I supposed to be optimistic if your app's file system isn't
4. DNS inspired scheme where the service is in DnD until the records that point to file directory for indexing get created or set or routed. This can help you play with key and value pairs as UTM parameters you can compress by leveraging ordering, creation and update data, hash change from creation, and the CRUD permissions that come free from attempting to access out of bounds or containorized data
5. Assume that everyone will share info and that not doing so is as much likely as a highly respected exam or test prep tutors. Ask your Indian friends or venture capital nerds about the market for exam prep. "A Class?" Put that on my file.

Here.
