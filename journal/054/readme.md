Monday May 3rd, 2021
Today is yesterday's tomorrow. Today is tomorrow's yesterday. Today is a gift to you to be present in. I, like anyone, could lose it now just as easily as I can in 21 hours and 55 minutes (how much is left in the day for me right now). For me and you; the danger is in only waiting for opportunity to knock. Who is there? No one. Stop looking behind you; no one is coming. Just change; or else you forget that we all have our own lives and problems....so yeah, just apply "20% more autonomy and authority" in any situation; you'll know when too much is too much. The chance I took on a CBT class I opted into to help me deal with stress, anxiety, & performance expectations (mostly self imposed). It's the class you take when you're at your weakest and need help and the same one your company will send you to if you need to take some "time and space".

Oh yea, I called b.s. on it until the last session. It was just a bunch of whiny babies complaining about their problems and life. Actually, hmmm....actually makes you see things in perspective. Oh, and you learn how to do deep breathing. Breathing in through your nose - stomach expanded - and breath out with your mouth slowly as you let the 8-pack unleash. Don't worry, I also think it's weird to check yourself out in the mirror if you're seeing physical changes in your body. It's okay, what you're going through is called sun burn and no it doesn't care about color or race. While you're on that, get some sun light and take in some nature to awe you into inspiration. Plant some too. It's proven to reduce crime by upto 70% when it's all green around you. Odd. Maybe the trees are going brrrrrrrr.


Okay, if you're seen me wear these dorky, geeky, & odd looking glasses....you may not be aware that I lived in the town Thomas Edison had his lab for 5th to 12th grade where I began to embrace my sensitivity to light. Could have been exacerbated by the amount of screen-time I have to deal with in my career. If you see me coming and leaving the office at whatever hour, it's b/c I spend more time at home working than at work. I do 1:1s, take coffee & Quest bar breaks, and play ping-pong with anyone at the company to learn and chat. I work on consumer monetization so that means everything is in your prevue. So just don't lisp, mumble, & slur your talking or fast talk through your fear b/c you might get so vengeful that you look up all the words you don't know when you read and rap like JCole/Drake/Wayne/Kendrick so you can play tennis with consonant and vowels. Yes, we make love and cry and turn up to your music. Stop getting an ego trip omg. Where's the next collab tho yo?

Oh, one last thing......when I came back from medical leave of absence and CBT classes...I wanted to make sure I showed Twitter that I appreciated them allowing me to discover mechanism design, systems design, & data engineering (+ roundtrip karting, baseball, & indoor diving) while I took a few months off and work on myself. I also learned I dominate conversations, didn't yet master argumentative writing, and that I was tired of playing nice and wasting an opportunity to embrace "intellectual courage" and actually make an impact that would allow me to cement my legacy as the most authentic, sentimental, & unwavering in integrity and "extreme ownership" for my job. It's tough being the first, youngest, or most X person of Y origin and Z privileges. I like MKBHD's take on it: "I want to be the best . (period); not the best black X." Same bro same. "Scared of the drop." I try to keep enjoying the same music, make the same cheesy and edgy jokes, and intentionally keep my personal life private because I want you to know that you can bring yourself, be yourself, and be selfish for others because I was willing to lose it all to make sure that non one ever told you that you can't talk like that; you can't grow up from that into or out of X; or that you have to be a jerk to work with)
(my hero got abandoned. Jaded by nations as he fought for my privacy, & missed time with his daughter. For that I promised myself I would be collaborative, technically & logically unf*ckablewith and that I would be an example to both my brothers and heritage about marriage and fatherhood as I spent my life building and innovating for my love and kids that you'd obviously feel because it would have to be everywhere so that the safety, autonomy, & freedom of my family & community are part of the system; no matter where or with who or without me. 

Long story short....I came back to Twitter as an entrepreneur instead of a PM (internally obv) and did whatever I wanted to do and felt like was worthwhile. As long as it represented the shareholders, board, & mission....I kind of just didn't care what management, culture, or OKRs said otherwise. Turns out, no one really asked and nobody really made me feel like I was out of place. I guess they just assumed if I felt like I was confident in being there, acting that way, and outspoken....then I must have earned it or been allowed. I doubled down. I wanted to do bottom of culture change. I wanted to impact the auction & marketplace dynamics so that one small change - if it works - would unlock billions of dollars in value and opportunity. 

My job was to pretty much get as much horizontal information & influence leverage, negotiate, leverage cross-functional org & talent to make sure I represent the user, business, & platform by balancing the needs, trade offs, & measure of value across all. I could go anywhere, ask anything, and reach out to anybody to make sure that I maximize my efficacy. Pretty much, a small list of people in the valley that could one day take over for the leaders of these platforms. So you're not supposed to know how good, loved, & trusted I am. I'm also sure that you can't get to this stage and level for this long without actually being really damn good; faking won't make you happy - even if it fulfils your desires. So now, out of respect, fear, & gratitude for all the companies, people, & burned bridges that helped me build who I am today....I would like to help us find a better solution than ads; calibrate the market, generational, & planarian metrics so we measure and reward on sustainable growth; and inspire and encourage technical founders to value secrets, winning as a team, & to never make anyone that bets on you look stupid.


Unfortunately, like many VCs, CEOs, & G's, I put in my time at Twitter to advance the democratically immutable; succinctly public, and openly expressive dialogue (which is different than a conversation - see 5th Discipline). The company thrives, survives, & relies on the people willing to pay their dues. Twitter is bigger in Japan than FB btw... So when you see us shitting on Twitter after we leave, it's because the company is at a stage where there's more work to do than there are people to do it. Because it's everywhere and really influential, we're all mindful of how we need to represent the company. So you can imagine how fun every morning ride was when people would give you the same old speech about who they saw on TV tweeting. 

Politics, ideologies, & personal agenda have to be put aside to make the place function as a sustainable business while being a very much needed utility in the world in my opinion. It remaining its own commercial entity is a good forcing function to operate with market transparency, rationality of short-squeezes, and "senator we sell ads about grills like you." I got paid the Glassdoor salary which was often beat by some new grad SWE offers and the APMs probably had bigger RSUs since they came in at a lower price and leveled up fast. I only took the job b/c my mentor told me we'd be sitting at the same lunch table in a year and that I was just stressing out and freaking out again about my life, career, & potential being on the brink of collapse. Ended up in the same table indeed and ended up in a company obsessed with bird puns. OMG! It kinda makes you wonder about the flight risk...hahah runs


Okay, not that you know how I got good and how to get good: I am no longer eligible, able, & morally impartial in being able to be one of those people that the execs, leadership, & board were hoping could grow into a replacement. It took 10 years for me to get here (b/c of natural & genuine interest I got to do it in 1/5 of the time it would have taken). So I want you to be able to do it in half the time it took me; no matter what you are running from, what you're running towards, and how awkwardly you run. Generally, most people slow down when they are close to the finish line. Generally, most people accept the prize that's not at the finish line. Generally, most people under estimate how hard it is to do something if you don't feel like you're somebody. I have f*ck you skills; not money or clout. 

So yes.....you're not Sherlock Homes....no one could fool Silicon Valley this long; go from founder to PM; and work at public companies without having measured and weighed the risks and decide to roll a hard 6. I changed a long time ago but it's not respectful to tell you about it. Better that I just focus on crafting excellence in a job that I feel is more a lifestyle than a career. I got diagnosed with ADHD less than 2 years ago so I can now share that I am grateful for the kindness of the DEA for allowing this drug to exist so I can actualize myself to the fullest and have the neuro psych to now discard the insecurity I once had about the drug being the hero and not me. Purpose, motivation, & priority come from your heart so it beating faster isn't going to make it faster. If you're Google CEO though, you might just wonder if it's enough for it to just feel fast. I agree....so let me just take a Dixon on this one and time travel into the future 40 years and bring back the things I would have wanted to be, do, or earn.....here's to day 54....the other 46 are on me. I'll see you tomorrow at 9 AM so make sure you're "eager to experience". You will never be here again; not with the same people; not as the same person; and not without using counterfactuals.


So, realize that you will never survive, sustain, or thrive in a strategy that aims to grow horizontally across all domains, skills, & roles if you're not the kind of person that can reason well about what you don't have to be told, asked, or expected to figure out. Also, don't screw people over. Not all of us want to celebrate, pick brains about, or catch-up the change that you went through. I know, happened to me too. It's enough that you go and change.......thank and forgive others b/c the cost we paid doesn't get recouped. We're just willing to be patient, graceful, & forgiving so you can have the space, time, & freedom to change. Stop making up for something. I want you to start at 0 and have it be from a place of abundance, affection, & respect (for yourself & equally for everyone).


Long before I got to all the fancy public companies, my boss at a dating app I worked on would spend hours with me whiteboarding crazy ideas and then go back to his VP role leading a multi-hundred person org and tens of PMs above my level b/c he believed in me & knew that I would own the product, team, & expectations like it was my own baby. When I was at Snap, it was so freaking wild to be at a company that's more impressive to get into than Google or Facebook (sorry not sorry). So when my ego was at its all time high and I felt like I was on top of the world, it meant a lot to me that I got the Netflix A Team treatment at Snap when I got a severance package after being laid off 3 months after starting. I missed everyone and everything when I moved to LA and didn't perform to the caliber that many expected. So like Netflix B players, I got a severance to make room for A players to get paid more. "No hurt feelings. I would do the same now. Always assume people have a positive intention until they prove you otherwise" was an advice Make School founder gave me back in 2016 that I still hang on to. 

After Evan wasted our only 1:1 telling me to just go work on hiring....I decided it would be good to show loyalty to Twitter when they allowed me to join the team only days after my reality check-day. On my last day, my boss's boss there shed tears as he had to give the sad news and for a moment I realized I was glad I didn't succeed too quickly b/c I don't think I would have been able to fire/lay-off/promote/hire and see it all in service of responsibly managing the livelihoods that are entrusted in me by my team, investors, & customers. Leadership is not easy and it made me want to stay an individual contributor. Not everyone wants to manage or inspire or be a vehicle for anything. "Vessel for the truth"? I can dig it. If I didn't put my name on here though...you wouldn't believe it's all one person b/c you can't imagine being equally into all these things. 


What's the cost? No brands, no politics, & no self-dealing. Respect is always the minimum. I make decisions; I never said they're good or fast or 1% of my portfolio. I'm writing this b/c I am petty and don't want to miss an opp. to shove it in people's face that now that I can talk like Drake, Obama, & a Fast Forward button.....I will choose to write. Might have to go back to talking soon though or otherwise someone may think I'm trying to be a speech writer. Think about it...how do you "write" a speech? That doesn't seem logically sound. Who knows, interpretive dancing might be next....

OMG my hands are actually tired. Btw, I've been getting better at typing without looking on my phone. Wow.....wish I was in school and had some typing classes. But, I did read once that internet IM, gaming, & forums allowed lots of people to learn English, self-expression, & cultural bridging. So, say "what" again? Double? Nope. "F the peace sign" letters print a new (day). I'm learning how to say "I'm done; I have nothing more to add." so I can stop rambling b/c none of you are interrupting me omg!!! I'm saying the same thing 3 times differently and faster. I can only sound confident about the things I know so don't be offended if I squeak in front of you while attempting to keep it 100 for the kids listening to trap music


Today: Self-serve and peer-review sourced tools to help us trade, collect, & curate the most effective routines that optimize for a desired, intended, & reversible lifestyle. Don't forget the lesson from the mindmap I shared a few days ago though: reversible ("Two way doors") decisions can damage 60-70% of your happiness compared to the irreversible decisions you make. So, no big deal. Take your time. Sips McFurry Dog Lattee
Make it a good day!

P.S. Do not send all or push if you're stoned, in your feelings, or haven't slept. You will cringe, smh, and "bruh" in the morning. We're talking about you…jk I will judge you only on how you talk about or treat others. So don't think you owe me anything for this. I already know I'm going to get a big win from just having published this for myself. I'd make a terrible writer. *starts another co. with a new latin word and today's powerball numbers*![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1840417/116869343-6b2dc200-abc5-11eb-9066-5f8b020e074b.png)
