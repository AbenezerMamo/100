# Mutually exclusive (what not to do)
1. "You look like Tony Hawk!"
2. My Originality *greaaaaattttt*


 # Collectively exhaustive (what to def. do)
1. Enumerating event space during a premortrem
2. 4 seasons. It's always sunny so you forget that it can fill the whole year and the gang is solving internet crimes


Just noticed my mind-mapping is just me finding an outlet to measure myself and my compulsions in a root-cause tree. It's like a super salad. Just goes in all directions. When you look at the leaf, you see another file system. Now that's a tactical tux :P
