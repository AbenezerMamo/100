Today is a new day! Today is a unique opportunity. Today is a chance to be en-chan-c-ted. *nervous laughter ensues*

# Dear Diary
Curious about the GDP impact & collateral emotional residue that break-ups have on the economy as a whole and a frailing heart, alone. Just asking for a friend. *nervous laughter in super salad*

Today: "Class commits". Scratch: "Class co....ommits". Freeze: No comment. Let's begin!

I was reading TechCrunch and landed on this article about some pre-seed fund and the lady who runs it said something along the lines of "increasing the rate of learning" and "rate of execution". It made me think a bit about how those two are different, cascading, & often pre-requisites (direction: next node). I've spent many a nights wondering which fantasy I should live out: a product designer or full-stack engineer or maybe economist. My inner Mitty takes charge and we spend the entire time deliberating decisions we aren't in the room to make, choices that were made for us long before, and motions that were more emotion than mot (moat - hehe). Anyway, long story short: you're very rarely going to regret learning the thing; anything!!!! (unless you need to forget, forgive, & forgo). Some people learn Mandarin to propose to their partners, some learn to double down on the flip flops, and others simply just build LA super teams. Whatever gets you going: get outta here kid. I don't want to keep you here for too long: you're either dirtying up my money & influence or really into self-absorbed philanthropy work...See: I always come through so you don't have to anymore. Okay bye!!!

Welcome back! You are now angry b/c you now realized okay maybe there are certain things you just wish you didn't know. For instance imagine leaving your PM job with lots of leadership skills and find yourself getting rekt when your funemployment musings turn into the regret of a lifetime: "what if I lead myself?" *WASTEEEEDDDDD* Idk man, the pen isn't working. Next week we explore the elegance of intelligently corning yourself into logical traps, wraps, & "oh crap"s
