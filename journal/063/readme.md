Whatever let's get to it. Hype. 


# Dear Diary
Thinking a lot today about structuring the afternoon so that I have a chance to think about what a four hour work day would look like.

1. Great place to start would be to imagine what each hour would look like sequentially it was laid out into 4 equal parts. (On this note: I would like to pick up Framer X, Typescript, & React up again so that I could leverage my prototyping experience to play around with a framework that can help me bridge my interests in visualizing decision making / control systems with my desire to get to high level of excellence as a data engineer, growth hacker, & product engineer by Day 80 that can be abstracted, encapuslated, & multiplied in forms of "Abenezer's API to help allocate & stream input & algo driven pull/push mech-turk-like abstractions".) [This is called real time parking-lot. Don't reject the serendepity you get blessed with; in fact, you can just decide you'll decide if you'll keep it or lose it later. My rule of thumb: "if it matters, i'll remember it later on". Also, this lets me use my anxiety as a powerful tool in project managment. There is no damn way in hell I will forget that thing. I can just spare myself the motions & emotions and not write it down. Might accidently abandon all the tools I mastered. Bruh we too advanced for you]
2. Thinking about the 4 hour blocks as a circular buffer (thanks make school data structures class. auto constraint this...). What if you assumed that the cicular (kinda like a clock...**Phelps stretch**). Maybe it can make things easier to build into routines or habits...




### Footnote (the kicker)
Listen. I didn't get this cool to sound not cool. It's just a lot easier and more fun to be generous when you can buy it too. For me, if it ain't happening 3 times....it ain't real fam. Sometimes though, the pleasant surprises can be really really reallly uplifting & the equivlant of watching a baby dance or a cat stand up or a dog just run into the wind. Okay, now I got so meta about my time that I can spend the entire day coming up with the most efficient, principled, & robhust......."an executive is measured on the efficacy of his work and his time" - A book I read a while back but won't say what it is b/c I thought I was better than the chapter about "rituals/culture". I'm pretty sure the girl I was working with def read that chapter b/c she's seeing the changes. Damn. Honestly. Damn. Sometimes you gotta watch or read something a few times to really get it. The "design your life" video I shared (also mindmap) didn't really make sense to me until I watched it limke 50-10 times by now. No matter how often I watch it, there's nothing like imagining being on the other end of "do you have some spare parts I can have?" Thanks G. Now I got this dude getting an ego trip about his music haha. Make it a good day ya'll

Today is a new day. Today is an opportunity. Today is a loaded chance - the strategically dominant allocation.

Would be nice to think more about how complex objectives get enumerated into subsequently more clear tasks and shared understanding in scope of the respective milestones. Ahem. "Where the * do I really even start?" Good question. Anywhere. Just look both ways before you cross (Sigh: Yeah assume it's intentional if I don't take the bait when it's set up so well and so tempting...) Golden crosses in my EMA! ETA^3

I can attest to the harsh realities of trying to solve your partners problems. Just smile and nod. Also, start from the presentation stage and build from there. Ok, bye!
