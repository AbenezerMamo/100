Today is a new day!
Today is a chance to take the opportunities that this coin lands on...*flips*
Which side did you want it to land on?

Don't look into it too much...you might want to timebox before you add too much outside the box. You know the box starts top left right?

Instead of spending the entirty of yesterday trying to 2x...you should have just divided by 2 man....then you find out the entire game is triangles. Ask 5 Ys and seek the "2nd and 3rd order of degree" to the changes that casscade before you start burning the midnight oil.

One small bit of insider insight I'll share from my Snapchat experience is about geo-filters, the product I worked on for organic & brand. When we think about sharing creative insights from organic usage for brands, we are careful to not try to do so much helping that we create fatigue, homogenous, & **mean girls rerference here* because the nature of the space we are in is transient, molded by original creators, and is applied to d*ck pics or grad pics that you don't want to flip the coin on. Working in that space taught me a great deal about what a brrand is, what the "government (us, the tax paying constituents) and the "company" (cultured PM writing PRD on ad quality & review) really mean. Everything is a social problem and soon enough, an org problem - eventually becoming my * problem. You don't need 21 garages to start change, just 3 is enough to "not break the chain". People make decisions, not organizations.

For the record,
An event (m)
