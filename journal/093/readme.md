# Dear Diary

I remember watching Little Horor Flowershop or something like it and thought about bus stops that could kind of be built in inverse.

1. Day starts and it's closed
2. Day progresses and it opens up
3. Model X falcon wings by the end of the day

Add-ons:

1. Aurora solar positioning for free
2. When in closed position, provides shelter for those in need of it
3. During summer, heat turns into energy
4. During winter, heat surface to summer levels to melt snow
5. During rain, it both collects and protects
6. During fall/spring, the fire nation awakens and you're using the force of the wind for somethig useful idk yet


Design:
1. Imagine a capital R
2. Your head is in the O part
3. Your feet can swing and stuff on the "n" part
4. You can unwrap the capital but it's optional
5. It moves with the day, time, & sun

Eng:
1. Self-sustainable
2. Reverse blooming of a flower so '
3. You're not supposed to hear or see it move
4. It's probably the later seasons of what it looks like

Back to life!
