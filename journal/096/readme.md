# Nice try kid, you should look into Mechanism Design, Control Systems, & the mirror because you my friend look like you could use a reality check - a friend

I get it, you can flip a screen kid....can't fool me. Unlike you, I can still cheat without tampering the evidence. I just flip the switch fam. Bit flip and you get Tibbers. Go hug something meaningful b/c I'm tired of having to save the world from kids like you who only rob themselves. Kid, stop trying to get an extra day. You only get 100 days because if you do it in a streak, you'd realize that there's all your buddies waiting for you to cement your place in history as "nice".

1. Nice guys finish last because it's how you take care of your lady
2. "Nice" guys finish last because they're too busy looking at the prize all the way to the finish line
3. Nice guys finish last because why finish in first if all you get to look at is the road? If that was the case then I would get me a Benz too. Save some energy...know what I mean ;)

I'll always be your #2 because my index starts at 0 so I'm your one (1) and only (1) forever (good thru [x2]). You can carry something for a day or for a year but it's upto you. Even the libra scale is tilted but it carries my "go-to" ;)
