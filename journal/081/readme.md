# Dear Diary

Let's jump right into it shall we!

### New paradigm for car design

* Driver front left and right passanger empty (think old racing days of Austins and Bentleys)
* The whole left side is a rectangular component that detaches the right-rear seat easily for crashes, parking, & "deconstructed" feel
* The whole point is that in any collision the opposing forces should yield a spin out; avoiding all forms of "ice puck", skidding, "Abe just trying to drift again", sleet, rain, etc...
* When you have the back right just be a passenger, you can make it easy to take your personal space with you insead of settling for what the driver has selected (i'm sure they want their entiror just as unique
* So now that you as a passenger (read-back) can coast, that now means we have technically a center-left engine (aka Ozil) but you can also play Kros because you have no right-front seat and the rear-back seat is empty right now
* Ladies and gents, I present to you the uni-car-thing......yea it's kinda like a motorcycle. Whenever I see movies try to stunt on me, I make sure I Stark the * out of the broken glass. So yea, Batmobile is aplicable too.
* Market? Priceless
