# Thursday April 15th, 2021

Today is a new day; an opportunity; and the present that I need to first unwrap for myself to understand what my community & the world expect of me when I grow up.



# Log & Scratch-pad

Today I find myself in contention with who I am still unable to grow into. I worry that this new day doesn't really feel all that new. There were still enviroment & self heuristics that worry me as complacency. So I'm going to attempt to define a new framework to give me further confidence that I'm working on the one thing each day that I am most needed on. By who? Let's define that...


## When will I be ready to recieve this change?
Comically, we say "when moon sir" in the crypto community but I think "are we there yet" is a much better question for this effort.

When will you be ready? When you're not too busy getting in your own way...

History is on right now and it's sounding like a broken record. Turns out, humans expect me and you to be at our peak of productivity - having spent the past 7 years figuring out "post-college". You're likely burned out, wiser, and if you had some good "Tunnel Vision", your wallet should be "obese". You've also probably had these past two quotes go over your head. It's okay, I want to make sure you can easily transition into another carreer, parenthood, and still lively in physical and spiritual health.
