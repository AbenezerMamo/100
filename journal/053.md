Today is a WeekEnd. Tomorrow will be a StrongStart. Here(14), make sure you add a "Marker" to that moment that just passed. You! Yes, you. Ok, there are two of you now. Hope you're measuring your speed in MPH (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) but I'd urge you to find your own drive - and then call it "dat a$$" so you can back it up and all the cache -  Est. Jan 1970; refurbished opportunity to your new day. If you have a date with chance, you'll only know she made out with Limbo if you show up. Good luck but do not take the howey spread - might be a pot hole or a thicc wick on that green candy tick sticker. Was a trader. Now an investor. Tomorrow: underwriter or underwater. Now: 'meow; click'

Note: I did not come up with these; I looked into the topic a while back and took notes. If you find the source: you can make a PR. But thanks whoever you are. Enjoy reader:
