Last shot: I'm moving this file from this folder to the main directory.
Vis-a-Vis: You can't cheat with the folder or the readme. * with me and I'll take the metaphors that will make parenting and self-help one fun trip. Can you imagine what it must be like for me?

This kid is wild bruh. I swear it's harder and harder but don't worry....I'm scared too bro. My friends getting liquidated. Introvert but now hosting the guac party bruh. No new friends!

I don't get 0 day'd by anyone; got it? I got 10,000 to the left and right of me dawg. So today I'm tryna work towards 1,000x GDP in the 34 remaining days. Day 1 and we don't accept any other prize. Not even more time. Read Canvas project for why

# Dear Diary

Where the * do I even start? I made sure kids who forked this one day didn't try to game the locations I've been changing man. I created a shortcut and a cheat code, shared it, and then burned it. I then fixed it, then made sure I left the dead man's hand by making sure I logically invalided it, ensured the governance didn't reward anything but what I had set out to do - show up for humanity for 100 days in a row; change. So when I say get back to creating upside instead of protecting downside, I mean it. Trust me, this should show you that you'd be screwed if you had to worry about what you don't understand or know or......(relax......) Smoke break. Man, this was stressful. Thank God I invested time in learning how to breath, eat right, & live a little. Make it a good day!

# It would be nice....

It would be nice to pick from the following to make targeted progress on....(root: w0rds matter inc.):
1. How to be coachable
2. How to make it easier to be helped
3. How to give complements and mean it
4. How to follow and lead & vice-versa
5. How to ask better questions to problems that may not have an answer yet, at all, or for a reason
6. How to avoid analysis paralysis that keeps the robot.txt away
7. How to "be good where you're at"
8. How to not freak it for all of us by thinking globalism is going to tolerate the way you're treating me. I only judge you on how you treat others so relax...

Enumerating as many questions as you can about an answer you don't even know where to even start for...

You can’t be trusted with secrets unless you recognize that trust is a bi-directional binding that will teach you a lifetime of lessons about why faith, family, & love are the bedrocks to making sure people celebrate you on the way up, in this life, & and in the new day you see; new opportunity you pursuit; and roof. Seee? I can art too. Stop…I’m not doing software security but I’m sure my friends would love to hear from you if you have opportunities for their friends to take the $10k bug bounty: the order of magnitude event that will never happen because for some….it’s a lifestyle and we all just trying to make the world dance man. Relax….now plenty of people realize the systemic change you wanna make may be limited by the stupid file system heuristics built into all of the hardware, OS, & literally language we didn’t realize they were hoping we’d not have waited this long to improve….So….I’m just here you can go through your power process dawg. Don’t trip…
