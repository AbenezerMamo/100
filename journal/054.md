Good try. Go build an OS, programming language, & 3rd price auction. Young metro better trust you bro; I'm willing to bet it on you so don't make me look stupid future baller. Gotta get me some courts, trees, and some head space (mental health up leveling)

If you take advantage of my authentic, conflict of interest void, and very easily (other side of the trade, funding to your competitors, & "broad day" CSPAN shakedown so don't try to profit of me or think I'm helping you undermine the reserve currency $100 or Libra scale)

Free beeer and the bar ain't even open. Being sedated, on things that can stay in your spine for a surprise shit trip (F5. Never.), or losing your ability to be without a vest or a thicc glass are things that matter to me. Find yours. If it seems like I'm trying to be offering opinions, I expect you to hold me accountable, shamed, and responsible. I got my own stuff I gotta grow into and out of. What I don't say, just don't. What I do: I'm showing up for all of you, me, and us. 034 more days. Stop trying to find shortcuts you little sh*t. But good try. Too advanced for you. File systems. Sigh...
