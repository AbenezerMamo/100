We belive everyone is elite at what they do and in bringing them together, you can empower the world. We belive the world is malluable, tactile, and tacit.

Too turnt up? Here's a freebie for Uncle Sam: When you have a store credit card, the locations you change won't be reflected in the store if only updated w/ credit compay. The credit bereau also gets it much later AND the payments you make only get propogated a few days later. Not to mention the bills that you pay land on different dates depending on your purchase time, month cycle, and whatever is in between. Got a couple fees pilled up? Want to make sure you ask about that to make sure they don't become the reason why you can't go through with paying it off and canceling it (which is not advice btw so be mindful of the benefits of long credit history). Also, you want to figure out how to handle or resolve this issue? You can't easily do so without being mindful of the negative nature of feedback that gets thrown their way and up the org ladder. Likely the bank and the store don't share data (for good reason) so they won't be able to propogate changes that are important for you and I to be responsible financially.

It's the opportunities we seek for a chance at breaking the cycle of pain and suffering that make the day truly new for us all. Banks, IRS, forgetful young adults, parents, & your credit history can all get behind these improvements. I actually had this issue for myself and figured I would share it here b/c I'm too lazy to follow up with their HQ and enterprise team to make it into a product change. I'm like "go away!" Step function jumps are about aligning incentives, individual autonomy, and the liberty to chamption for the common collective goood.


I told you we gonna hit 1,000x GDP. Faith. In God we trust.

Cheers,
A good day; we make it!
