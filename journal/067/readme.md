# Sunday May 16th, 2021

The mere presence of this folder and the absence of cheating myself out of Day 1 and Day 100 alignment is a reason to celebrate!

I threw this in before I walked in but here it is anyway; ya dig: "1"-Pager of abandoned aspirations to uplevel myself as a Product Manager and finally get promoted from the level i started at since 2016. I'm an advanced beginner. I don't know/ain't/bull shit. Say "what" again? Told you FB I don't * with you no more. Can't me the 2nd biggest hiring mistake if you screw my ability to ever be the youngest PM and have to now live under the shadow of this little sh*t who thinks he's somebody. But just in case you thought the rap was a joke; African business magnate continues to dominate while Joaquin digs this joke. Patents, VC, & Pam are all at In-Q-Tell so please stop assuming I'm trying to be James Bond or something. I was promised chores, homework, & an agent to make me their toy while kids unbox your life, moms & singles make marketers bend the knee, and flags on the silver hood play Civ V with Magnus, Messi, & everyone and their family/super-teams playing sports. Oh yeah, Palantir is public now so that's a vibe. Experience? Market. Oh? $1B in donation to the justice department from a hacker? Um, optimal stoping problem haters split and now one saved me from blackmail and the other stunned on you givers while Elon is still struggling to keep the photons in the dark; keep the $100M and buy one of these kids a Scenna or P1 so they don't feel so ashamed of God blesss free market, democracy, & asymmetry. Me? I'm not driving because I struggle to feel safe with the risk I pose to you. Both from a passion, forms of disability, & lack of maturity. So don't randomly play songs and be surprised when I tear up. For all of you who do get to and stunt whirl doing it: I appreciate you and will vegetate you by building self-autonomy, mobility, &  "the journey" into my countdown because you better believe I'm avoiding things I know are just "danger zone" seeking thrills that will risk my ability to come show up everyday for humanity for 33 more days. What's the destination for if the marshmallows is expired, worm turned out to make my tummy have buttteflies, and the apple has an enclave for all your shared "doctors hate him" secrets which makes the whole "scribble" iPad pencil feature kinda have sense. Ha! Just in case: mental/physical/spiritual health care for entrepreneurs is kinda high key important and I hope you can learn to appreciate why I don't think you should change at all to succeed. Just be yourself, aim for a life of no regrets, and don't take advantage of unconditional love that I expect you to one day be the heir of the onus it will burden you with. Be selfish for others and know that my life as an evangelist for God's forgiveness & Christ's love: I could have been anyone else too so please allow me to respectfully represent what makes me feel proud of my faith as a Child of God and a brother to all of you, my hard work, and my patience. When you get to where you want to be, I will pay attention; personally better off as a beneficiary of your work - impartially; and can decide for myself what I want to take and keep from you without feeling like I can get empowered without a clap back :P gg wp "1 more!"

Make it a good day; a day to rest; and a blessing for everything and everyone around you! 

# Dear Diary
I keep forgetting I'm an engineer and not inspiration. So here's the last link I'll share to help guide you towards education so I can go back to building the tools, mechanisms, & bridges to achieve my goal of earning your mom's trust to make education personalized; the first in history to be tax free other than religion and ....wait....what if there are teachers, history, & and organizations who have an interest in you being your own teacher....???? I want you to build a life that is free of struggle and leave you with my faith just as my parents wished for me and sacrificed so much now to both he alive to hopefully be proud by. But then of course I need to go back to my usual b.s. just in case any parent is trying to tell their kid to be more like me. Pls don't. Can't avoid just wanting to be like me if I don't build a like button. Like...."I didn't know we had a like"
