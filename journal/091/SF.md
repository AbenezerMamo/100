# SF

I was told bagels, celebs next door, & incentives for filing patents just won't be like West Orange, Thomas Edison Club Dancing Jersey.

Recently they, we, learned what global geopolitics is and that water did it first.

Oh, I'M the lover boy now? It's good to have roots with voices and mic. I'm just the sprint guy amongst runners


Thank you SF for being part of my adulthood. Lived in so many parts so it's okay to talk $22M. Let's park that idea. Build more courts pls thx u

You know they tell you to dress for the weather. Talking chances -- talking about these bone... -- oh, my shirt? hackathon...was in the middle of psycho & icon. -- Prince & The Parody

But seriously: super awesome for cool people to live and work in these places and make it clear that we all share the same cities. There is the coffee shops for your table and a table to caffinate your entire cap on
That's how they flex. Shades *puts on Gunnar glaxes from Best Buy, online, or anywhere gamers are* I thought lights would be clear to these cities man....
