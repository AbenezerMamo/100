# Thursday April 22nd, 2021

Yesterday was feeling a little too sentimental so I did a reset. Came back to the same place. Nothing to see here...

1. Today is a new day (for half the world)
2. Today is an opportunity
3. Today is a chance to chant our anthem. If you hear me play music, it's not for you but do let me know if I need to keep it down. Otherwise, I plan on saving my breath for your comments and instead offer office-hours and critique sessions at least once a weekend (15 min cap). I might selfishly try to elicit demand in the future in hopes of trying to build some matching service. Until then, consider that you could do the same and will likely be bettter. As you can see, I'm in my feelings today and you have to make sure my function is pure. So still have to find someone or come up with a better solution to do comms consistently and do follow-ups and take notes. It's almost as if this project needs a PM and you get an eng. Tryinig to figure out if I can make it so easy to do the boring stuff, it might be a random pick or it could be a way for you to beat me to it because i probably don't even know what the actual end state looks like. If it is, then you might be able to build that bridge. How do we do this inspiration from a text file thing Not sure yet....
