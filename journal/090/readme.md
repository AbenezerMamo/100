Bigotry will not have a place in this world. Those who believe it does will be reminded that the last 10 days mean little to nothing compared to the duty, honor, and privilage in putting you in your place. Liberty is defended by those who see its kindle warmth to be a shelter for the freedoms we seek. God is good. I have all that the world can offer and seek not much more than to appreciate all that you'll do as we all cheer you on your journey there. Make it a great day!

When politicians look to lower their cost per acquisition, reach & frequency efficency, or game the 2nd price auctions...we simply remind them the importance of neutral civic involvement. If you operate an internet service globally and are burdened with delicate geopolitics, it helps to lean on your officials. When decisions have no precedence, binary outcome, & don't have a win/loss definition, it helps to lean on God for guidance, grace, & the stomach to stand up to the largest of history figures. Thanks Steve; means so much to me that it cost you something only a few will understand.

Make it a good day!
