Bigotry will not have a place in this world. Those who believe it does will be reminded that the last 10 days mean little to nothing compared to the duty, honor, and privilage in putting you in your place. Liberty is defended by those who see its kindle warmth to be a shelter for the freedoms we seek. God is good. I have all that the world can offer and seek not much more than to appreciate all that you'll do as we all cheer you on your journey there. Make it a great day!
