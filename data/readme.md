Are you driven?
Are you sound?
Are you timely, atomic, & ready to deter nialists from 1920s, 1940s, AND 2020s?
Are you informative and intelligent?

# How to talk to your developer about data?

Is your developer avoiding necessary telemetry & instrumentation that will hold myopic OKRs accountable?
Is your data scientist a mad scientist with the SQL but refuses to JOIN those two little things together and refuses to find a middle ground?
Is your data architect thinking about getting tats and freaking a Hoonigan and straight inline v8 from the GT? Slick...The other one is swimming in a data lake with Sandy across the bridge (import x6 from pandas)

# How to bench science with no press?

What is the dashboard that can sit on our homepage and on our seed round's minted Massarati since they still haven't found comfort with $47B of pure pigment magic I.P. you can trace if you cough up a Hal or try a Genesis engine block....right 43....tight turn in 90.....
What is "the market" *crowd does the wave and pom-poms root* measuring you on that may go against the future interest of your users? (1st full-time PM job was with a boss who dared to challenge me to get rid of our users if we want to succeed. See, I told you I'd help you get laid faster than Mark would. They read "hopeless romantic" and thought it was a joke *shakes in rom com*)
Have your comms operation & creative style be driven by feelings & emotion that can make the voice your customers characterize more authentic as it embodies the quirky, awkward, & totally-over-the-top personality of the people & $USD_BTC_ETH_BIRRRRRRR$?

# How to do a data roll-up like a Highlander when User Generated Content is hard to quantify?

What would you imagine you'd feel if this data was 1/100th, 100x, or 99.97% yesterday, today, or tomorrow? (Careful, it might already be tomorrow if globalization is applied directly to....)
At what point would this data create active information avoidance, thoughts of refactoring or rebasing to HEAD, or forecasting with collateral without totally considering what happens when you try to hold people accountable? *10 digits my accountant but ad-lib my CD 4x a year homie. Quarter every quarter before the quarter. $8M, $8B, and now $8T....* "I didn't know we had $8T" - Luke warm kinda money - it ain't average...just an arbitrage trying to find the Nutella spread so the homies don't get liquidated

# How do I susscribe to the broadcasts which only have integer returns if I get tired of what comes with empowerment?

1. Ensure that you're using data types that can conform to timestamp standards end-to-end that allow you to take advantage of interoperable time-series data
2. Define an internal schema mapping that binds each port in the 0 to 9 dial (I took inspiration from a creative app developer mapping each dial-pad # into an input-label control-system in a tally/counter app. Super creative and mad respect on really really leveraging the native controls. You wouldn't think of this in a smart phone and it kind of made the whole "you needed digital to come up with analog")
3. On Day Z (Block # equivlant), Y will unlock; so long as the elapsed time between the 1st and 2nd is greater than the 2nd and 3rd longest duration. The expectation is that each subsequent record holds with it a reference that the first and last won't. It's expected that you measure your success based on how short you can make the delta between the first and the last. I hope this inspires a class of problems to be measure the gain and loss of the functions that limit....never mind. Being measured on outcomes v.s. output is the kind of OvO shade Ethiopians love throwing around anyway haha Seriously, it's privilage to have a dream come true to be able to work tirelessly and with vigor, inguenuity, & intimate courage towards outcomes that sqeueeze rationality out of the  market's pricing; today's mission we're in service of; and the fruits we will stand to manage tomorrow.

There you go...3 is all you need to start a habit, chain, streak, routine, etc...
