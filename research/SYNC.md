# Sync book notes

1. Electricity has a capacitor and a transistor. The capacitor has a quick and short ascend as it begins to taper off the amount of energy displaced or deffered onto the capacitor. Over time, the acceleration of energy has diminished and the capacitor should return to normal default state. The cyclical nature for the oscilation pattern to cascade into synchrony is what makes truly evident the 2nd and 3rd degree effects of the individual actions that successively self-correct in accordance to their neighbors. Only the points on the capacitor's capacity measure that are closest in proximity are the ones that fire or contribute energy towards. The weaker and lower energy measures are not accounted for and are ignored.
